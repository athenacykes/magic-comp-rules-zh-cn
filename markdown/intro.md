# 前言

本文件是*万智牌*®竞技游戏的最终解释。本文件包括一系列编号的规则，以及随后的附录。很多规则分为更详细的子规则，并且每条规则或子规则都有自己唯一的编号。（为防止与数字“1”和“0”混淆，子规则的编号跳过了字母“l”和“o”；例如，规则704.5k之后是704.5m，然后是704.5n，再然后是704.5p。）   
This document is the ultimate authority for Magic: The Gathering® competitive game play. It consists of a series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number. (Note that subrules skip the letters “l” and “o” due to potential confusion with the numbers “1” and “0”; subrule 704.5k is followed by 704.5m, then 704.5n, then 704.5p, for example.)
