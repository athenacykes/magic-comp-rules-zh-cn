# 8. 多人游戏规则 Multiplayer Rules
## <span id='cr800'>800.</span> 总则 General
<b id='cr800-1'>800.1.</b> 多人游戏指游戏开始时有多于两位牌手参加的游戏。此部分规则还包含进行多人游戏时可采用的附加模式之规则。   
<b>800.1.</b> A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.

<b id='cr800-2'>800.2.</b> 这些规则包含数个多人游戏时可采用的附加模式，以及数种多人游戏的玩法。一盘游戏可以采用多个附加模式，但只会有一种玩法。   
<b>800.2.</b> These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.

<b id='cr800-3'>800.3.</b> 此部分规则并不包含很多万智牌多人游戏可以用到的附加规则，包括套牌构组规则。更多信息参见最新版本的万智牌比赛规则。可以在[http://WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents]找到这些内容。   
<b>800.3.</b> Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.

<b id='cr800-4'>800.4.</b> 与双人游戏不同，多人游戏中即使有一位或多位牌手离开游戏，游戏也不会因此结束。   
<b>800.4.</b> Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.

<b id='cr800-4a'>800.4a</b> 当一位牌手离开游戏时，所有由该牌手拥有的物件（参见规则[109](./1#cr109)）便会离开游戏，且任何给予该牌手操控其他物件或牌手之操控权的效应终止。然后，如果该牌手操控任何堆叠上不由牌所代表的物件，这些物件消失。然后，如果仍有物件由该牌手操控，放逐这些物件。这并非状态动作。只要有牌手离开游戏便会立刻执行。如果离开游戏的牌手在离开游戏时持有优先权，则依回合顺序将优先权让过给下一位仍在游戏中的牌手。   
<b>800.4a</b> When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 109) owned by that player leave the game and any effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left, priority passes to the next player in turn order who’s still in the game.

例如：俊杰施放心灵操控，一个叙述为“你操控所结附的生物”的灵气，并结附在天启的突袭狮鹫上。如果俊杰离开游戏，则心灵操控也会离开游戏，突袭狮鹫会回到由天启来操控。如果改为天启离开游戏，则突袭狮鹫也会离开游戏，心灵操控因此而置入俊杰的坟墓场。   
Example: Alex casts Mind Control, an Aura that reads, “You control enchanted creature,” on Bianca’s Assault Griffin. If Alex leaves the game, so does Mind Control, and Assault Griffin reverts to Bianca’s control. If, instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Assault Griffin, and Mind Control is put into Alex’s graveyard.

例如：俊杰施放叛行，其部分叙述为“获得目标生物的操控权直到回合结束”，并指定天启的符爪熊为目标。如果俊杰离开游戏，则叛行改变操控权的效应结束，符爪熊会回到由天启来操控。   
Example: Alex casts Act of Treason, which reads, in part, “Gain control of target creature until end of turn,” targeting Bianca’s Runeclaw Bears. If Alex leaves the game, Act of Treason’s change-of-control effect ends and Runeclaw Bears reverts to Bianca’s control.

例如：俊杰施放贿赂，其叙述为“从目标对手的牌库中搜寻一张生物牌，并将该牌在你的操控下放进战场。然后该牌手将其牌库洗牌”，并指定天启为目标。俊杰将天启牌库中的撒拉天使放进战场。如果天启离开游戏，则撒拉天使也会离开游戏。如果改为俊杰离开游戏，则撒拉天使会被放逐。   
Example: Alex casts Bribery, which reads, “Search target opponent’s library for a creature card and put that card onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library,” targeting Bianca. Alex puts Serra Angel onto the battlefield from Bianca’s library. If Bianca leaves the game, Serra Angel also leaves the game. If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Serra Angel is exiled.

例如：俊杰操控创生秘室，其叙述为“每当一个非衍生物的生物进入战场时，如果创生秘室并未横置，则该生物的操控者派出一个1/1无色秘耳衍生神器生物。”如果俊杰离开游戏，则所有在俊杰操控下进入战场的此类秘耳衍生物也会离开游戏，而所有在其他牌手操控下进入战场的此类秘耳衍生物仍会留在游戏中。   
Example: Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, “Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield, if Genesis Chamber is untapped, that creature’s controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.” If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under Alex’s control leave the game, and all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other player’s control remain in the game.

<b id='cr800-4b'>800.4b</b> 如果一位已离开游戏的牌手将得到一个物件的操控权，则该物件的操控权不发生改变。如果一个衍生物将在已离开游戏牌手的操控下被派出，则该衍生物不会被派出。如果一个物件将在一位已离开游戏的牌手操控下放进战场或堆叠，该物件留在其原来的区域。如果一位牌手将被一位已离开游戏的牌手操控，该牌手不会被操控。   
<b>800.4b</b> If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesn’t. If a token would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they aren’t.

<b id='cr800-4c'>800.4c</b> 如果一个效应给予仍在游戏中的牌手某物件的操控权结束，且没有其他效应将该物件的操控权给予其他仍在游戏中的牌手，且该物件的默认操控者已离开游戏，该物件被放逐。这并非状态动作。一旦改变操控权的效应结束便会立刻执行。   
<b>800.4c</b> If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the player who controlled that object by default has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the control-changing effect ends.

<b id='cr800-4d'>800.4d</b> 如果一个由已离开游戏的牌手所拥有物件将于某区域中被创造，则它不会被创造。如果一个由已离开游戏的牌手所操控的触发式异能将被放进堆叠，则它不会进入堆叠。   
<b>800.4d</b> If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it isn’t created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put onto the stack, it isn’t put on the stack.

例如：星幽滑移是叙述为“每当任一牌手循环一张牌时，你可以放逐目标生物。若你如此作，在下一个结束步骤开始时，将该生物在其拥有者的操控下移回战场”的结界。在俊杰的回合中，天启用星幽滑移的异能放逐了俊杰的催眠幽灵。在该回合结束之前，天启离开了游戏。在结束步骤开始时，星幽滑移所创造的延迟触发式异能试图将催眠幽灵移回战场，但该异能并未进入堆叠。所以催眠幽灵将不会被移回战场。   
Example: Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, “Whenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield under its owner’s control at the beginning of the next end step.” During Alex’s turn, Bianca uses Astral Slide’s ability to exile Alex’s Hypnotic Specter. Before the end of that turn, Bianca leaves the game. At the beginning of the end step, the delayed triggered ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic Specter to the battlefield triggers, but it isn’t put on the stack. Hypnotic Specter never returns to the battlefield.

<b id='cr800-4e'>800.4e</b> 如果将对已离开游戏的牌手造成战斗伤害，则该伤害不会造成。   
<b>800.4e</b> If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isn’t assigned.

<b id='cr800-4f'>800.4f</b> 如果一个物件需要由已离开游戏的牌手来支付费用或选择是否支付费用，该费用不会被支付。   
<b>800.4f</b> If an object requires a player who has left the game to pay a cost or choose whether to pay a cost, that cost is not paid.

<b id='cr800-4g'>800.4g</b> 如果一个物件需要由已离开游戏的牌手来作出除是否支付费用以外的选择，则该物件的操控者选择另一位牌手来作出该选择。如果需由该物件操控者的对手来对该物件作出选择，则如果可能，该牌手选择另一位对手。   
<b>800.4g</b> If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice other than whether to pay a cost, the controller of the object chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible.

<b id='cr800-4h'>800.4h</b> 如果一条规则要求已经离开游戏之牌手作出选择，则相应改为依回合顺序的下一位牌手作出该选择。   
<b>800.4h</b> If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order makes that choice.

<b id='cr800-4i'>800.4i</b> 如果一个效应需要知道特定牌手的信息，且该牌手仍在游戏中，则该效应使用该牌手当前的信息。否则，该效应使用该牌手离开游戏前的最后已知信息。如果一个效应需要知道牌手已作出的动作之游戏信息，该效应能够得知已离开游戏之牌手所作出的动作。   
<b>800.4i</b> If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about that player before they left the game. If an effect requires information from the game about actions players have taken, the effect can find actions that were taken by a player who has left the game.

<b id='cr800-4j'>800.4j</b> 如果牌手在自己的回合中离开游戏，该回合会在没有主动牌手的情况下继续到完全结束。如果主动牌手将得到优先权，则相应改为依回合顺序将优先权让过给下一位牌手、结算堆叠顶端的物件，或当前阶段或步骤结束。   
<b>800.4j</b> If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate.

<b id='cr800-4k'>800.4k</b> 如果一个已经离开游戏的牌手将要开始一个回合，该回合不会开始。   
<b>800.4k</b> If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesn’t begin.

<b id='cr800-4m'>800.4m</b> 当一位牌手离开游戏时，将持续到该牌手下个回合或该回合中的特定时间点的持续性效应会持续到该回合本将开始时。这些效应不会立即结束，也不会一直生效。   
<b>800.4m</b> When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player’s next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.

<b id='cr800-4n'>800.4n</b> 当一位牌手离开游戏时，在赌注区中由该牌手拥有的物件不会离开游戏。这是规则[800.4a](./8#cr800-4a)的例外情况。参见规则[407](./4#cr407)，“赌注”。   
<b>800.4n</b> When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This is an exception to rule 800.4a. See rule 407, “Ante.”

<b id='cr800-4p'>800.4p</b> 在竞逐时空游戏中，如果当前指定为时空操控者的牌手将离开游戏，改为回合顺序中下一位不会离开游戏的牌手成为时空操控者，然后原来的时空操控者离开游戏。参见规则[311.5](./3#cr311-5)。   
<b>800.4p</b> In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. See rule 311.5.

<b id='cr800-5'>800.5.</b> 除非已选择的玩法或附加模式有规定在先，否则座位顺序由各方都同意的方式来决定。例如，牌手可以同意沿用游戏开始前的就座位置，或是以掷骰子的方式决定座位顺序，等等。   
<b>800.5.</b> Unless a chosen variant or option prescribes otherwise, seating order is determined by any mutually agreeable method. For example, players could agree to remain where they were before the game began, roll dice to determine seating order, and so on.

<b id='cr800-6'>800.6.</b> 在多人游戏中，在依照其已执行再调度的次数计算牌手应置于牌库底的牌张数量时，该牌手第一次执行的再调度不会计入该数量。第一次再调度之后的再调度会正常计入该数量。   
<b>800.6.</b> In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.

<b id='cr800-7'>800.7.</b> 在一盘非双头巨人玩法的多人游戏中，先手牌手不略过他第一个回合的抓牌步骤。在双头巨人玩法的游戏中，先手队伍略过他们第一个回合的抓牌步骤。参见规则[103.8](./1#cr103-8)。   
<b>800.7.</b> In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesn’t skip the draw step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. See rule 103.8.

## <span id='cr801'>801.</span> 限制影响范围模式 Limited Range of Influence Option
<b id='cr801-1'>801.1.</b> 限制影响范围是一个可以在大多数多人游戏中使用的模式。皇帝玩法总是使用它（参见规则[809](./8#cr809)），且在五位或更多牌手参与的游戏中经常被使用。   
<b>801.1.</b> Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. It’s always used in the Emperor variant (see rule 809), and it’s often used for games involving five or more players.

<b id='cr801-2'>801.2.</b> 一位牌手的影响范围指，从该牌手开始，以座位为单位，其可以影响的最大范围。离该牌手此数量座位以内的牌手在其影响范围以内。该牌手影响范围以内的牌手所操控的物件也在该牌手的影响范围以内。影响范围包括咒语、异能、效应、造成伤害、攻击、作出选择，以及赢得游戏。   
<b>801.2.</b> A player’s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player’s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a player’s range of influence are also within that player’s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making choices, and winning the game.

<b id='cr801-2a'>801.2a</b> 最常用的选择是影响范围为1或2个座位。不同的牌手可以有不同的影响范围。   
<b>801.2a</b> The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may have different ranges of influence.

例如：影响范围为1指，只有你以及和坐在你两侧的牌手在你的影响范围之内。   
Example: A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players seated directly next to you are within your range of influence.

例如：影响范围为2指，你和你左手边两位牌手，以及右手边两位牌手在你的影响范围之内。   
Example: A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to your left and the two players to your right are within your range of influence.

<b id='cr801-2b'>801.2b</b> 一位牌手总是在其自己的影响范围之内。   
<b>801.2b</b> A player is always within their own range of influence.

<b id='cr801-2c'>801.2c</b> 于每个回合开始时确定某位牌手是否在每位牌手的影响范围以内。   
<b>801.2c</b> The particular players within each player’s range of influence are determined as each turn begins.

例如：在一盘影响范围为1的游戏中，俊杰坐在天启的左边，而阿炯坐在天启的右边。阿炯不在俊杰的影响范围之内。如果天启离开游戏，则阿炯会在下一个回合开始时，进入俊杰的影响范围之内。   
Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa is seated to the right of Rob. Carissa is not in Alex’s range of influence. If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter Alex’s range of influence at the start of the next turn.

<b id='cr801-2d'>801.2d</b> 如果一个物件的操控者为一位牌手或该牌手影响范围以内的牌手，则该物件处于该牌手的影响范围以内。额外地，如果一个战役的防卫者为一位牌手或该牌手影响范围以内的牌手，则该战役处于该牌手的影响范围以内。   
<b>801.2d</b> An object is within a player’s range of influence if it’s controlled by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player. In addition, a battle is within a player’s range of influence if it’s protected by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player.

<b id='cr801-3'>801.3.</b> 生物只能攻击在其操控者影响范围之内的对手、这些对手操控的鹏洛客，或是这些对手防卫的战役。如果一位牌手的影响范围内没有对手存在，则该牌手操控的生物不能进行攻击。   
<b>801.3.</b> Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller’s range of influence, planeswalkers controlled by those opponents, and battles protected by those opponents. If no opponents are within a player’s range of influence, creatures that player controls can’t attack.

<b id='cr801-4'>801.4.</b> 一位牌手操控的咒语和异能不能指定其影响范围之外的物件和牌手为目标。   
<b>801.4.</b> Objects and players outside a player’s range of influence can’t be the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.

<b id='cr801-5'>801.5.</b> 一些牌会要求牌手作出选择。在采用限制影响范围的模式时，这些牌的运作方式会有所不同。   
<b>801.5.</b> Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used.

<b id='cr801-5a'>801.5a</b> 如果一位牌手被要求选择一个物件或牌手，其必须选择影响范围以内的物件或牌手。   
<b>801.5a</b> If a player is asked to choose an object or player, they must choose one within their range of influence.

例如：在一盘影响范围为1的游戏中，俊杰坐在天启的左边。俊杰起动孔坡棘女巫的“{T}：你选择任意一个目标，任一对手选择任意一个目标。孔坡棘女巫对前者造成1点伤害，并对后者造成1点伤害。”异能，指定天启为目标，并选择天启为指定另一个目标的对手。天启必须选择同时处于自己和孔坡棘女巫操控者影响范围内的物件来作为目标。因此只能在自己、俊杰、一个由自己或俊杰操控的生物中作出选择。   
Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, “{T}: Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to any target and 1 damage to any target of an opponent’s choice,” targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other target. Rob must choose a target that’s in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either himself or Alex.

<b id='cr801-5b'>801.5b</b> 如果牌手需要在一个或数个选项中作出选择（但不是在一个或数个物件或牌手中作出选择），则即使这些选项涉及的物件或牌手不在该牌手的影响范围之内，其也可以在这些选项中作出选择。   
<b>801.5b</b> If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the player’s range of influence.

例如：坐在天启左边的俊杰之影响范围为2，坐在天启右边的阿炯之影响范围为1。俊杰施放了一个叙述为“由一位对手选择一项～你抓两张牌；或每个由你操控的生物得+2/+2直到回合结束”的咒语，并选择阿炯来作出选择。则即使俊杰不在阿炯的影响范围之内，阿炯依然可以为其选择模式。   
Example: Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has a range of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex casts a spell that reads, “An opponent chooses one — You draw two cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,” and chooses Carissa to make that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range.

<b id='cr801-5c'>801.5c</b> 如果一个效应需要牌手来作出选择，但该效应操控者影响范围内没有可以作出选择的牌手，则由离该牌手左侧最近的相应牌手作出该选择。   
<b>801.5c</b> If an effect requires a choice and there’s no player who can make that choice within its controller’s range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controller’s left makes that choice.

例如：在一盘所有牌手的影响范围都是1的皇帝玩法的游戏中，一位皇帝施放了真伪莫辩，其叙述为“展示你牌库顶上的五张牌。一位对手将这些牌分成牌面朝上的两堆。将其中一堆牌置于你手上，另一堆牌置于你的坟墓场。”由于在皇帝的影响范围内没有对手，则由离皇帝左侧最近的对手来进行分堆。   
Example: In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction, which reads, “Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.” Since no opponent is within the emperor’s range of influence, the nearest opponent to the emperor’s left separates the cards into piles.

<b id='cr801-6'>801.6.</b> 牌手不能起动其影响范围以外之物件的起动式异能。   
<b>801.6.</b> A player can’t activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.

<b id='cr801-7'>801.7.</b> 除非整个触发事件在其来源之操控者影响范围内发生，否则该触发式异能不会触发。   
<b>801.7.</b> A triggered ability doesn’t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of influence of its source’s controller.

例如：在一盘所有牌手均限定影响范围为1的游戏中，俊杰坐在天启的左侧。天启操控了两个灵气，它们贴附于俊杰的符爪熊上：其中一个的触发条件为“每当受此结界的生物被阻挡时”，而另一个的触发条件为“每当受此结界的生物被生物阻挡时”。俊杰的符爪熊攻击其左边的牌手并被阻挡。第一个灵气的异能会触发，因为整个事件（符爪熊被阻挡）在天启的影响范围内发生。但是天启第二个灵气的异能不会触发，因为该触发事件中包含了阻挡生物，而该阻挡生物并不在天启的影响范围之内。   
Example: In a game in which all players have range of influence 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Rob controls two Auras attached to Alex’s Runeclaw Bear: One with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked,” and one with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked by a creature.” Alex’s Runeclaw Bear attacks the player to Alex’s left and becomes blocked. The ability of Rob’s first Aura triggers because the entire event (Runeclaw Bear becomes blocked) happens within Rob’s range of influence. The ability of Rob’s second Aura doesn’t trigger, however, because that event includes the blocking creature, which is out of Rob’s range.

<b id='cr801-7a'>801.7a</b> 如果一个触发事件包含了将一个物件移出或移入牌手的影响范围，则相应地根据此事件之前或之后的游戏状态来决定该异能是否触发。参见规则[603.6](./6#cr603-6)及[603.10](./6#cr603-10)。   
<b>801.7a</b> If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a player’s range of influence, use the game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger. See rules 603.6 and 603.10.

例如：天启和俊杰互不在对方的影响范围之内。天启操控一个由俊杰拥有的符爪熊，且两人各操控一个榨取恶魔，一个具有部分叙述为“每当另一个生物离开战场时，你可以令目标牌手磨两张牌。”的生物。符爪熊被消灭，然后被置入俊杰的坟墓场。俊杰的榨取恶魔的异能不会触发，因为离开战场事件发生在俊杰的影响范围之外。而天启的榨取恶魔的异能会触发，因为离开战场事件发生在天启的影响范围之内，尽管该生物是被置入其影响范围之外的坟墓场。   
Example: Carissa and Alex are outside each other’s range of influence. Carissa controls a Runeclaw Bear owned by Alex and they each control an Extractor Demon, a creature which reads, in part, “Whenever another creature leaves the battlefield, you may have target player mill two cards.” The Runeclaw Bear is destroyed and is put into Alex’s graveyard. The ability of Alex’s Extractor Demon doesn’t trigger because the leaves-the-battlefield event was outside Alex’s range of influence. The ability of Carissa’s Extractor Demon does trigger, even though the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the leaves-the-battlefield event was within her range.

<b id='cr801-8'>801.8.</b> 灵气不能结附在其操控者影响范围之外的物件或牌手上。如果一个灵气贴附于非法的物件或牌手上，该灵气将会作为状态动作被置入其拥有者的坟墓场。参见规则[704](./7#cr704)。   
<b>801.8.</b> An Aura can’t enchant an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action. See rule 704.

<b id='cr801-9'>801.9.</b> 武具不能佩带到其操控者影响范围之外的物件上，工事也不能构工到其操控者影响范围之外的物件上。如果一个武具或工事贴附于非法的永久物上，它会从该永久物上卸装，但仍留在战场上。此为状态动作。参见规则[704](./7#cr704)。   
<b>801.9.</b> An Equipment can’t equip an object outside its controller’s range of influence, and a Fortification can’t fortify an object outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.

<b id='cr801-10'>801.10.</b> 咒语或异能不能影响其操控者影响范围之外的物件或牌手。如果效应的一部分试图影响在范围之外的物件或牌手，则该部分效应无效。其余效应将正常生效。   
<b>801.10.</b> Spells and abilities can’t affect objects or players outside their controller’s range of influence. The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of the effect will work normally.

例如：在一盘每位牌手影响范围为1的六人游戏中，俊杰施放烈火断层，其叙述为“烈火断层对每个生物造成2点伤害。”则烈火断层会对由俊杰、俊杰左侧的牌手，以及俊杰右侧的牌手所操控的每个生物各造成2点伤害。其他生物不会受到伤害。   
Example: In a six-player game in which each player has range of influence 1, Alex casts Pyroclasm, which reads, “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. No other creatures are dealt damage.

<b id='cr801-11'>801.11.</b> 如果一个咒语或异能需要得知游戏的信息，则它只会使用其操控者影响范围内的信息。它并不会注意到其操控者影响范围之外的物件或事件。   
<b>801.11.</b> If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its controller’s range of influence. It doesn’t see objects or events outside its controller’s range of influence.

例如：在一盘每位牌手影响范围为1的六人游戏中，俊杰操控武装外衣，其叙述为“对每个生物而言，战场上每有一个与它具共通之生物类别的其他生物，它便得+1/+1。”武装外衣仅会依据俊杰、俊杰左侧的牌手，以及俊杰右侧的牌手所操控的生物情况来增强俊杰的生物。它不会将其他生物计算在内。   
Example: In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex controls Coat of Arms, which reads, “Each creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature on the battlefield that shares at least one creature type with it.” Coat of Arms will boost Alex’s creatures based only on what creatures are controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. It won’t take other creatures into account.

例如：同一盘游戏中，天启坐在俊杰的右侧。武装外衣会依据俊杰的影响范围内的牌手所操控的生物来增强天启的生物，包括坐在俊杰左侧的（并且在天启影响范围之外的）牌手。   
Example: In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex. Coat of Arms will boost Rob’s creatures based on what creatures are controlled by players within Alex’s range of influence, including the player sitting to Alex’s left, who’s out of Rob’s range of influence.

<b id='cr801-12'>801.12.</b> 只有当其操控者影响范围内有其他普世永久物时，“普世规则”（参见规则[704.5k](./7#cr704-5k)）才会对一个永久物生效。   
<b>801.12.</b> The “world rule” (see rule 704.5k) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within its controller’s range of influence.

<b id='cr801-13'>801.13.</b> 替代性及防止性效应会监视特定事件，并在其发生时完全或部分地替代该效应。限制影响范围的模式可能使改动后的事件包含无法实现的指示。在此情形下，牌手忽视此不能实现的指示。参见规则[614](./6#cr614)，“替代性效应”和规则[615](./6#cr615)，“防止性效应”。   
<b>801.13.</b> Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions. See rule 614, “Replacement Effects,” and rule 615, “Prevention Effects.”

<b id='cr801-13a'>801.13a</b> 如果一个替代性效应试图使一个咒语或异能影响其操控者影响范围以外的物件或牌手，则该部分事件无效。   
<b>801.13a</b> If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.

例如：俊杰施放熔岩斧（“熔岩斧对目标牌手或鹏洛客造成5点伤害”），并指定天启为熔岩斧的目标。天启响应施放X=3的船长的巧驭（“于本回合中，接下来将对目标生物、鹏洛客或牌手造成的X点伤害，改为对另一个目标生物、鹏洛客或牌手造成之。”），并指定阿炯为目标。阿炯并不在俊杰的影响范围内。当熔岩斧结算时，它只会对天启造成2点伤害，而不会对阿炯造成伤害。   
Example: Alex casts Lava Axe (“Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker.”) targeting Rob. In response, Rob casts Captain’s Maneuver (“The next X damage that would be dealt to target creature, planeswalker, or player this turn is dealt to another target creature, planeswalker, or player instead.”) with X equal to 3, targeting Carissa. Carissa isn’t in Alex’s range of influence. When Lava Axe resolves, it deals 2 damage to Rob and no damage to Carissa.

<b id='cr801-13b'>801.13b</b> 如果咒语或异能创造了一个将防止某来源将要造成之伤害的效应，则它只能影响该咒语或异能操控者影响范围内的来源。如果咒语或异能创造了一个将防止对一个生物或牌手造成之伤害的效应，则它只能影响该咒语或异能操控者影响范围内的生物或牌手。如果咒语或异能创造了一个将防止伤害的效应，但既没有注明来源，也没有注明将要被防止伤害者，则只有当伤害来源与将要受到该伤害者同时在该咒语或异能的操控者影响范围内时，该效应才会防止伤害。   
<b>801.13b</b> If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can affect only sources within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a permanent or player, it can affect only permanents and players within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence.

例如：天启在俊杰的影响范围之内，但阿炯不在。俊杰操控一个结界，其叙述为“防止生物将造成的所有伤害。”阿炯用一个生物攻击天启，则该生物会对天启造成战斗伤害。   
Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Alex controls an enchantment that says, “Prevent all damage that would be dealt by creatures.” Carissa attacks Rob with a creature. The creature deals combat damage to Rob.

例如：天启在俊杰的影响范围之内，但阿炯不在。阿炯施放闪电冲击波（“闪电冲击波对任意一个目标造成4点伤害”），并指定天启为目标。俊杰响应施放施以援手（“于本回合中，防止接下来将对任意一个目标造成的4点伤害。”），并指定天启为目标。则对天启的伤害将被防止。   
Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa casts Lightning Blast (“Lightning Blast deals 4 damage to any target.”) targeting Rob. In response, Alex casts Mending Hands (“Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”) targeting Rob. The damage to Rob is prevented.

例如：天启在俊杰的影响范围之内，但阿炯不在。阿炯用一个生物攻击天启，且天启用一个生物进行阻挡。俊杰施放圣日（“于本回合中，防止将造成的所有战斗伤害”）。则阿炯和天启的生物会互相造成战斗伤害。   
Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa attacks Rob with a creature, and Rob blocks with a creature. Alex casts Fog (“Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.”) Carissa and Rob’s creatures deal combat damage to each other.

<b id='cr801-14'>801.14.</b> 如果一个效应指定一位牌手赢得游戏，则改为所有该牌手影响范围内的对手输去游戏。   
<b>801.14.</b> If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that player’s opponents within that player’s range of influence lose the game instead.

<b id='cr801-15'>801.15.</b> 如果一个咒语或异能的效应将使得当前游戏为平手，则只有该咒语或异能的操控者以及在该牌手影响范围之内的所有牌手会以平手结束本盘游戏。他们离开游戏。所有其余牌手继续进行游戏。   
<b>801.15.</b> If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell or ability’s controller and all players within that player’s range of influence. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.

<b id='cr801-16'>801.16.</b> 如果游戏中出现了强制动作组成的“循环”，重复一系列事件且无法停止，对于循环中包含的每个物件之操控者，以及在这些牌手影响范围内的每位牌手，游戏为平手。这些牌手离开游戏。其余牌手继续游戏。   
<b>801.16.</b> If the game somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object that’s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.

<b id='cr801-17'>801.17.</b> 重新开始游戏的效应（参见规则[724](./7#cr724)）不受限制影响范围模式的限制。所有仍在游戏中的牌手将会开始新游戏。   
<b>801.17.</b> Effects that restart the game (see rule 723) are exempt from the limited range of influence option. All players in the game will be involved in the new game.

<b id='cr801-18'>801.18.</b> 在多人竞逐时空游戏中，除了大型混战玩法之外，时空牌和异象牌均不受限制影响范围模式限制。这些牌的异能及该些异能的效应，会对游戏中所有适用的物件和牌手产生影响。参见规则[901](./9#cr901)，“竞逐时空”。   
<b>801.18.</b> In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. See rule 901, “Planechase.”

## <span id='cr802'>802.</span> 攻击复数牌手模式 Attack Multiple Players Option
<b id='cr802-1'>802.1.</b> 一些多人游戏会允许主动牌手攻击多位其他牌手。如果采用了本模式，牌手仍可以在某些战斗中选择只攻击一位牌手。   
<b>802.1.</b> Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.

<b id='cr802-2'>802.2.</b> 于战斗阶段开始时，攻击牌手不用选择哪一位对手成为防御牌手。改为在战斗阶段中，所有攻击牌手的对手都是防御牌手。   
<b>802.2.</b> As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesn’t choose an opponent to become the defending player. Instead, all the attacking player’s opponents are defending players during the combat phase.

<b id='cr802-2a'>802.2a</b> 任何提及“防御牌手”的规则、物件，或是效应，指一位特定的防御牌手，而不是所有防御牌手。如果一个攻击生物的异能提及防御牌手，或一个咒语或异能同时提及攻击生物和防御牌手，除非另有指定，该防御牌手指该生物正在攻击的牌手、其正在攻击的鹏洛客的操控者，或是其正在攻击的战役的防卫者。如果该生物不再进行攻击，该防御牌手指该生物被移出战斗之前所攻击的牌手、所攻击的鹏洛客的操控者，或是所攻击的战役的防卫者。如果一个咒语或异能可以对多个攻击生物生效，分别为每个攻击生物确定其所对应的防御牌手。如果有多位防御牌手可供选择，则由该咒语或异能的操控者选择其中一位。   
<b>802.2a</b> Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that player is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that player was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.

例如：天启用符爪熊攻击俊杰，并用另一个具山脉行者异能的生物攻击阿炯。具有山脉行者异能的生物是否能被阻挡只取决于阿炯是否操控山脉。   
Example: Rob attacks Alex with Runeclaw Bear and attacks Carissa with a creature with mountainwalk. Whether the creature with mountainwalk can be blocked depends only on whether Carissa controls a Mountain.

<b id='cr802-3'>802.3.</b> 于攻击牌手宣告攻击生物时，其为每个攻击生物各选择攻击哪一位防御牌手或是哪一个鹏洛客。参见规则[508](./5#cr508)，“宣告攻击者步骤”。   
<b>802.3.</b> As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they choose a defending player, a planeswalker controlled by a defending player, or a battle protected by a defending player for it to attack. See rule 508, “Declare Attackers Step.”

<b id='cr802-3a'>802.3a</b> 不因攻击特定牌手而生效的限制与要求，会基于整组攻击生物来判断是否符合限制与要求。因攻击特定牌手而生效的限制与要求，只会对攻击该牌手的攻击生物来作出判断。整组的攻击生物依然必须合法。参见规则[508.1](./5#cr508-1)。   
<b>802.3a</b> Restrictions and requirements that don’t apply to attacking a specific player are evaluated based on the entire group of attacking creatures. Restrictions and requirements that apply to attacking a specific player apply only to creatures attacking that player. The entire group of attacking creatures must still be legal. See rule 508.1.

<b id='cr802-3b'>802.3b</b> 同一个攻击团队中的生物不能攻击不同的牌手。参见规则[702.22](./7#cr702-22)，“结合”。   
<b>802.3b</b> Creatures in a band can’t attack different players. See rule 702.22, “Banding.”

<b id='cr802-4'>802.4.</b> 如果有多位牌手、其操控的鹏洛客或其防卫的战役正在被攻击，则于宣告阻挡者步骤开始时，防御牌手们按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序来宣告阻挡者。（参见规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)和规则[509](./5#cr509)，“宣告阻挡者步骤”。）第一位防御牌手首先宣告其所有的阻挡，然后第二位牌手进行宣告，以此类推。   
<b>802.4.</b> If more than one player is being attacked, controls a planeswalker that’s being attacked, or protects a battle that’s being attacked, each defending player in APNAP order declares blockers as the declare blockers step begins. (See rule 101.4 and rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”) The first defending player declares all their blocks, then the second defending player, and so on.

<b id='cr802-4a'>802.4a</b> 防御牌手只能用自己操控的生物进行阻挡。这些生物只能阻挡正在攻击该牌手、该牌手操控的鹏洛客或该牌手防卫的战役之攻击生物。   
<b>802.4a</b> A defending player can block only with creatures they control. Those creatures can block only creatures attacking that player, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects.

<b id='cr802-4b'>802.4b</b> 当决定一位防御牌手的阻挡是否合法时，忽略正在对其他牌手进行攻击的生物，以及由其他牌手操控的阻挡生物。   
<b>802.4b</b> When determining whether a defending player’s blocks are legal, ignore any creatures attacking other players and any blocking creatures controlled by other players.

<b id='cr802-5'>802.5.</b> 宣告阻挡之后，如果有生物阻挡了多个生物，则每位防御牌手按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序，为其操控的每个阻挡生物对攻击生物宣告伤害分配顺序。参见规则[510](./5#cr510)，“战斗伤害步骤”。   
<b>802.5.</b> After blockers have been declared, if any creatures are blocking multiple creatures, each defending player in APNAP order announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures for each blocking creature they control. See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”

<b id='cr802-6'>802.6.</b> 战斗伤害按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序进行分配。除此之外，战斗伤害步骤以与双人游戏一样的方式进行。参见规则[510](./5#cr510)，“战斗伤害步骤”。   
<b>802.6.</b> Combat damage is assigned in APNAP order. Other than that, the combat damage step proceeds just as in a two-player game. See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”

## <span id='cr803'>803.</span> 攻击左边或右边模式 Attack Left and Attack Right Options
<b id='cr803-1'>803.1.</b> 一些多人游戏会使用攻击左边或攻击右边模式的规则。   
<b>803.1.</b> Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right rules.

<b id='cr803-1a'>803.1a</b> 如果使用攻击左边的模式，牌手只能攻击直接坐在其左侧的对手、该对手操控的鹏洛客，或是该对手防卫的战役。如果该牌手左边最近的对手与其距离大于一个座位，该牌手不能攻击。   
<b>803.1a</b> If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their left, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects. If a player’s nearest opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.

<b id='cr803-1b'>803.1b</b> 如果使用攻击右边的模式，牌手只能攻击直接坐在其右侧的对手、该对手操控的鹏洛客，或是该对手防卫的战役。如果该牌手右边最近的对手与其距离大于一个座位，该牌手不能攻击。   
<b>803.1b</b> If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their right, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects. If a player’s nearest opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.

## <span id='cr804'>804.</span> 调动生物模式 Deploy Creatures Option
<b id='cr804-1'>804.1.</b> 皇帝玩法总是会使用调动生物模式，且在其他玩法中，如果该玩法允许牌手以组队的方式进行对抗，则也可以使用这一模式。以个人进行对抗的多人玩法通常不会采用此模式。   
<b>804.1.</b> The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it can be used in other variants that allow players to compete in teams. Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually don’t use this option.

<b id='cr804-2'>804.2.</b> 每个生物均具有异能“{T}：目标队友获得此生物的操控权。只能于法术时机起动。”   
<b>804.2.</b> Each creature has the ability “{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Activate only as a sorcery.”

## <span id='cr805'>805.</span> 队伍共享回合模式 Shared Team Turns Option
<b id='cr805-1'>805.1.</b> 一些队伍之间的多人游戏使用队伍共享回合模式。双头巨人玩法（参见规则[810](./8#cr810)）和魔王休闲式玩法（参见规则[904](./9#cr904)）总是使用这种模式。只有队伍成员坐在相邻座位时才使用这种模式。   
<b>805.1.</b> Some multiplayer games between teams use the shared team turns option. It’s always used in the Two-Headed Giant variant (see rule 810) and the Archenemy casual variant (see rule 904). It can be used only if the members of each team are sitting in adjacent seats.

<b id='cr805-2'>805.2.</b> 在每个队伍中，以该队伍视角坐在最右面的牌手是主要牌手。如果队伍中的牌手无法一致同意某个选择，例如哪些生物进行攻击或触发式异能放进堆叠的顺序，主要牌手作出选择。   
<b>805.2.</b> Within each team, the player seated in the rightmost seat from that team’s perspective is the primary player. If the players on a team can’t agree on a choice, such as which creatures attack or what order triggered abilities are put on the stack, the primary player makes that choice.

<b id='cr805-3'>805.3.</b> 使用规则[103.1](./1#cr103-1)所叙述的方式来决定哪个队伍进行第一个回合。以此方式决定的队伍是先手队伍。   
<b>805.3.</b> The methods described in rule 103.1 are used to determine which team will take the first turn. The team determined this way is the starting team.

<b id='cr805-3a'>805.3a</b> 处理再调度的流程有所不同。首先由先手队伍中的每位牌手以任意顺序宣告其是否进行再调度，然后其他队伍中的每位牌手按照回合顺序依次宣告。在作出决定时队友可以相互商量。然后所有再调度同时执行。队友间在选择哪张牌（如有）要放到牌库底时可相互商量。一位牌手可以执行再调度，即使其队友已决定保留起手牌。参见规则[103.5](./1#cr103-5)。   
<b>805.3a</b> The process for handling mulligans is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, declares whether that player will take a mulligan. Then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. Teammates may consult while choosing which cards, if any, to put on the bottom of their library. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand. See rule 103.5.

<b id='cr805-3b'>805.3b</b> 处理一些允许牌手以其在战场上的形式开始游戏的牌之流程有所不同。首先由先手队伍中的每位牌手以任意顺序将任意或所有此类牌张从其起手牌放进战场。在作出决定时队友可以相互询问。然后按照回合顺序，其他队伍中的每位牌手依次执行这些动作。   
<b>805.3b</b> The process for handling cards that allow a player to begin the game with them on the battlefield is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, may put any or all such cards onto the battlefield from that player’s opening hand. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.

<b id='cr805-4'>805.4.</b> 每个队伍来进行回合，而非每位牌手。   
<b>805.4.</b> Each team takes turns rather than each player.

<b id='cr805-4a'>805.4a</b> 进行其回合的队伍是主动队伍。其他每个队伍都是非主动队伍。   
<b>805.4a</b> The team whose turn it is is the active team. Each other team is a nonactive team.

<b id='cr805-4b'>805.4b</b> 队伍中的每位牌手于其队伍的抓牌步骤中抓一张牌。   
<b>805.4b</b> Each player on a team draws a card during that team’s draw step.

<b id='cr805-4c'>805.4c</b> 队伍中的每位牌手于其队伍的每个回合中可以使用一张地。   
<b>805.4c</b> Each player on a team may play a land during each of that team’s turns.

<b id='cr805-4d'>805.4d</b> 一个在阶段或步骤开始时触发的异能如果其在“每位牌手的”或“每位对手的”阶段或步骤开始时触发，则可能会触发多次。如果这些异能的触发条件、效应或以“若”开头的子句提及“该牌手”、“该对手”等类似情形，则它对于每个适用的牌手都会触发一次。   
<b>805.4d</b> An ability that triggers at the beginning of a step or phase may trigger multiple times if it triggers at the beginning of “each player’s” or “each opponent’s” step or phase. These abilities trigger once for each appropriate player if the ability’s trigger condition, effect, or intervening “if” clause refers to “that player,” “that opponent,” or similar.

<b id='cr805-5'>805.5.</b> 队伍拥有优先权，而非单独的牌手。   
<b>805.5.</b> Teams have priority, not individual players.

<b id='cr805-5a'>805.5a</b> 牌手可以于其队伍拥有优先权时施放咒语、起动异能或执行特殊动作。   
<b>805.5a</b> A player may cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action when their team has priority.

<b id='cr805-5b'>805.5b</b> 如果队伍拥有优先权，且该队伍中没有任何牌手想要作事，该队伍让过。如果所有队伍依序让过（即所有队伍在让过之间中没有任何牌手想要执行动作），堆叠顶的物件结算，然后主动队伍得到优先权。如果所有队伍依序让过时堆叠为空，当前阶段或步骤结束，下一个阶段或步骤开始。   
<b>805.5b</b> If a team has priority and no player on that team wishes to do anything, that team passes. If all teams pass in succession (that is, if all teams pass without any player taking any actions in between passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active team receives priority. If the stack is empty when all teams pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.

<b id='cr805-6'>805.6.</b> “主动牌手先决定”规则（参见规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)）在使用队伍共享回合模式时有所不同。若多个队伍需要同时作决定和/或采取动作，则先由主动队伍作出选择，然后每个非主动队伍按照回合顺序作出选择。若多位牌手需要同时作决定和/或采取动作，则先由主动队伍上的牌手作出选择，然后再由每个非主动队伍上的牌手按照回合顺序作出选择。一旦所有决定完成，这些动作同时生效。   
<b>805.6.</b> The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see rule 101.4) is modified if the shared team turns option is used. If multiple teams would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first the active team makes any choices required, then each nonactive team in turn order makes any choices required. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first each player on the active team makes any choices required in whatever order they like, then the players on each nonactive team in turn order do the same. Once all choices have been made, the actions happen simultaneously.

<b id='cr805-6a'>805.6a</b> 在使用队伍共享回合模式的多人游戏中，如果多位牌手被指示抓牌，首先由主动队伍的每位牌手以任意顺序进行该牌手的抓牌，然后每个非主动队伍按回合顺序以同样的方式完成抓牌。   
<b>805.6a</b> If more than one player is instructed to draw cards in a game that’s using the shared team turns option, first each player on the active team, in whatever order that team likes, performs that player’s draws, then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.

<b id='cr805-7'>805.7.</b> 如果自上一次队伍得到优先权之后有多个触发式异能触发，首先由主动队伍的牌手将其操控的触发式异能以任意顺序放进堆叠，然后每个非主动队伍的牌手按回合顺序以同样的方式将异能放进堆叠。   
<b>805.7.</b> If multiple triggered abilities have triggered since the last time a team received priority, the members of the active team put all triggered abilities any of them controls on the stack in any order they choose, then the members of each nonactive team in turn order do the same.

<b id='cr805-8'>805.8.</b> 如果某效应给予牌手额外回合，或在该牌手回合中增加阶段或步骤，该牌手的队伍进行该额外回合、阶段或步骤。如果某效应使得牌手略过回合、阶段或步骤，该牌手的队伍略过之。如果同一个效应使得同一队伍中的多位牌手增加或略过同一个回合、阶段或步骤，该队伍只会增加或略过该回合、阶段或步骤。如果某效应使得牌手操控另一位牌手，前者牌手操控受影响之牌手的队伍。   
<b>805.8.</b> If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step to that player’s turn, that player’s team takes the extra turn, phase, or step. If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that player’s team does so. If a single effect causes more than one player on the same team to add or skip the same step, phase, or turn, that team adds or skips only that step, phase, or turn. If an effect causes a player to control another player, the first player controls the affected player’s team.

<b id='cr805-9'>805.9.</b> 提及“主动牌手”的异能仅指一位特定的主动牌手，而非所有的主动牌手。该异能的操控者于其效应生效时选择该异能指代的是哪位牌手。   
<b>805.9.</b> Any ability that refers to the “active player” refers to one specific active player, not to all of the active players. The ability’s controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is applied.

<b id='cr805-10'>805.10.</b> 队伍共享回合模式使用与其他多人模式不同的战斗规则。   
<b>805.10.</b> The shared team turns option uses different combat rules than other multiplayer options.

<b id='cr805-10a'>805.10a</b> 每个队伍所操控的生物一同攻击另一个队伍。在战斗阶段中，主动队伍是攻击队伍，且主动队伍中的每位牌手都是攻击牌手。同样地，非主动队伍是防御队伍，且非主动队伍中的每位牌手都是防御牌手。   
<b>805.10a</b> Each team’s creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is the attacking team and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is the defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.

<b id='cr805-10b'>805.10b</b> 于宣告攻击者步骤开始时，主动队伍宣告攻击者。对于每个攻击生物而言，主动队伍宣告该生物攻击哪个防御牌手、鹏洛客或战役。主动队伍仅进行一次联合攻击，且攻击生物之集合必须作为整体合法地宣告攻击。参见规则[508.1](./5#cr508-1)。   
<b>805.10b</b> As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. For each attacking creature, the attacking team announces which defending player, planeswalker, or battle that creature is attacking. The active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 508.1.

<b id='cr805-10c'>805.10c</b> 任何提及“攻击牌手”的规则、物件或效应仅指代一位特定的攻击牌手，而非所有攻击牌手。如果一个进行阻挡的生物之异能提及一位攻击牌手，或一个咒语或异能同时提及一个进行阻挡的生物和一位攻击牌手，除非另有说明，其指代的攻击牌手是被该进行阻挡的生物阻挡之进行攻击的生物的操控者。如果一个咒语或异能可以对多个进行阻挡的生物生效，对于每个进行阻挡的生物而言，其对应的攻击牌手会分别决定。如果可能会选择多位攻击牌手，该咒语或异能的操控者选择其一。   
<b>805.10c</b> Any rule, object, or effect that refers to an “attacking player” refers to one specific attacking player, not to all attacking players. If an ability of a blocking creature refers to an attacking player, or a spell or ability refers to both a blocking creature and an attacking player, then unless otherwise specified, the attacking player it’s referring to is the player who controls the attacking creature that blocking creature is blocking. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple blocking creatures, the appropriate attacking player is individually determined for each of those blocking creatures. If there are multiple attacking players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.

<b id='cr805-10d'>805.10d</b> 于宣告阻挡者步骤开始时，防御队伍宣告阻挡者。所有防御牌手操控之生物均可阻挡攻击防御队伍中任何牌手、其操控的鹏洛客或其防卫的战役之生物。防御队伍仅进行一次联合阻挡，且进行阻挡的生物之集合必须作为整体合法地宣告阻挡。参见规则[509.1](./5#cr509-1)。   
<b>805.10d</b> As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by the defending players can block creatures attacking any player on the defending team, attacking a planeswalker controlled by one of those players, or a battle protected by one of those players.

<b id='cr805-10e'>805.10e</b> 任何提及“防御牌手”的规则、物件，或是效应，指一位特定的防御牌手，而不是所有防御牌手。如果一个攻击生物的异能提及防御牌手，或一个咒语或异能同时提及攻击生物和防御牌手，除非另有指定，该防御牌手指该生物正在攻击的牌手、其正在攻击的鹏洛客的操控者，或是其正在攻击的战役的防卫者。如果该生物不再进行攻击，该防御牌手指该生物被移出战斗之前所攻击的牌手、所攻击的鹏洛客的操控者，或是所攻击的战役的防卫者。如果一个咒语或异能可以对多个攻击生物生效，分别为每个攻击生物确定其所对应的防御牌手。如果有多位防御牌手可供选择，则由该咒语或异能的操控者选择其中一位。   
<b>805.10e</b> Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.

## <span id='cr806'>806.</span> 自由竞赛玩法 Free-for-All Variant
<b id='cr806-1'>806.1.</b> 在自由竞赛的多人游戏中，牌手们会以个人方式来互相展开对抗。   
<b>806.1.</b> In Free-for-All multiplayer games, a group of players compete as individuals against each other.

<b id='cr806-2'>806.2.</b> 在游戏开始前，需要决定将使用哪些多人游戏的模式。自由竞赛玩法通常会默认使用下列模式。   
<b>806.2.</b> Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Free-for-All variant uses the following default options.

<b id='cr806-2a'>806.2a</b> 自由竞赛游戏通常不使用限制影响范围的模式。如果使用了该模式，则需在游戏开始前就决定影响范围为多大，且所有牌手会具有相同的影响范围。参见规则[801](./8#cr801)，“限制影响范围模式”。   
<b>806.2a</b> The limited range of influence option usually isn’t used in Free-for-All games. If it is, each player has the same range of influence, which is determined before play begins. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”

<b id='cr806-2b'>806.2b</b> 必须使用攻击左边、攻击右边，以及攻击复数牌手这三个模式中的一个。参见规则[803](./8#cr803)，“攻击左边或右边模式”，和规则[802](./8#cr802)，“攻击复数牌手模式”。   
<b>806.2b</b> Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”

<b>806.3.</b> The players are randomly seated around the table.

## <span id='cr807'>807.</span> 大型混战玩法 Grand Melee Variant
<b id='cr807-1'>807.1.</b> 大型混战玩法是基于自由竞赛玩法的改动，牌手会以个人方式展开对抗。大型混战玩法通常只在游戏开始时有十位或更多牌手参加的情况下使用。   
<b>807.1.</b> The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant, in which a group of players compete against each other as individuals. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more players.

<b id='cr807-2'>807.2.</b> 游戏开始前需要决定使用哪些多人游戏模式。大型混战玩法会默认使用以下模式。   
<b>807.2.</b> Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the following default options.

<b id='cr807-2a'>807.2a</b> 每位牌手的影响范围均为1（参见规则[801](./8#cr801)）。   
<b>807.2a</b> Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see rule 801).

<b id='cr807-2b'>807.2b</b> 使用攻击左边模式（参见规则[803](./8#cr803)）。   
<b>807.2b</b> The attack left option is used (see rule 803).

<b id='cr807-2c'>807.2c</b> 在大型混战玩法中，不使用攻击多位牌手模式和调动生物模式。   
<b>807.2c</b> The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options aren’t used in the Grand Melee variant.

<b id='cr807-3'>807.3.</b> 牌手需随机入座。   
<b>807.3.</b> The players are seated at random.

<b id='cr807-4'>807.4.</b> 大型混战玩法允许多位牌手同时进行回合。移动回合标记以追踪目前由哪些牌手正在进行回合。每个回合标记都表示一位主动牌手的回合。   
<b>807.4.</b> The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers keep track of which players are currently taking turns. Each turn marker represents an active player’s turn.

<b id='cr807-4a'>807.4a</b> 游戏中每满四位牌手，便会有一个回合标记。   
<b>807.4a</b> There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.

例如：一盘有十六位牌手的大型混战玩法的游戏使用四个回合标记。一盘有十五位牌手的游戏使用三个回合标记。   
Example: A Grand Melee game with sixteen players has four turn markers. A game with fifteen players has three turn markers.

<b id='cr807-4b'>807.4b</b> 开始游戏的牌手会得到第一个回合标记。该牌手左起第四个座位的牌手（第五位牌手）会得到第二个回合标记，依此类推直到所有回合标记都分发完毕。每个回合标记都会以此法分配到一个数字。然后所有拥有回合标记的牌手同时开始他们的回合。   
<b>807.4b</b> The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that player’s left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns at the same time.

<b id='cr807-4c'>807.4c</b> 当一位牌手结束其回合时，该牌手将回合标记让过给其左侧的牌手。如果拥有回合标记的牌手在其回合中离开游戏，该牌手左面的牌手在该回合结束后得到回合标记。如果拥有回合标记的牌手在其回合开始前离开游戏，该牌手左面的牌手立即得到回合标记。   
<b>807.4c</b> After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to their left takes the turn marker immediately.

<b id='cr807-4d'>807.4d</b> 如果一位牌手左起三个座位中有牌手持有回合标记，则该牌手不能得到回合标记。在此情形下，该牌手须等待直到其左起第四个座位的牌手得到该回合标记。   
<b>807.4d</b> A player who receives a turn marker can’t begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker.

<b id='cr807-4e'>807.4e</b> 如果一位牌手离开游戏，且回合标记的数量因该牌手离开游戏而减少，离开游戏的牌手右方的回合标记指定为将被移除。如果多位牌手同时离开游戏，回合标记的数量因这些牌手离开游戏而减少，并且有多个回合标记可能会被移除，编号最小的回合标记指定为将被移除。同一个回合标记可能会多次指定为将被移除。   
<b>807.4e</b> If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed player’s right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times.

<b id='cr807-4f'>807.4f</b> 当一位或多位牌手离开游戏，决定是否有回合标记将被移除时（参见规则[807.4e](./8#cr807-4e)），忽略已经指定为将被移除的回合标记。   
<b>807.4f</b> For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal.

<b id='cr807-4g'>807.4g</b> 如果正在进行回合的牌手拥有将被移除的回合标记，于该回合结束时移除该回合标记，而非将其传给下一位牌手。如果一位尚未进行回合的牌手拥有将被移除的回合标记，该回合标记立即移除。如果一个已移除的回合标记被多次指定为将被移除，该回合标记右侧的回合标记指定为将被移除，且指定次数为该回合标记被指定之次数减去一。   
<b>807.4g</b> If a player who’s taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player who’s not taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal that many times minus one.

<b id='cr807-4h'>807.4h</b> 如果一位或多位相邻座位的牌手离开游戏，这些牌手两侧的牌手直到下个回合开始时才会进入彼此的影响范围。   
<b>807.4h</b> If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of those seats don’t enter one another’s range of influence until the next turn begins.

<b id='cr807-4i'>807.4i</b> 如果某效应使得拥有回合标记的牌手于当前回合之后额外进行一个回合，除非另一个回合标记距离该牌手太近，该牌手于当前回合结束后保留回合标记并开始其下一个回合。如果该牌手左侧的回合标记距离该牌手三个座位之内，该额外回合等待直到该牌手左侧距其四个座位的牌手开始其回合后才开始进行。如果该牌手右侧的回合标记距离该牌手三个座位之内，该牌手将其回合标记传给左面的牌手（而非保留之），且该牌手在进行其下一个回合之前立即开始该额外回合。   
<b>807.4i</b> If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.

<b id='cr807-4j'>807.4j</b> 如果一个效应令某牌手在当前回合结束后进行一个额外的回合，但该牌手在此回合开始时将不会持有回合标记，则改为在该牌手进行其下一个回合之前首先进行此额外的回合。   
<b>807.4j</b> If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldn’t have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead.

例如：在俊杰的回合中，他施放了时间行走[Time Walk]，令他在本回合结束后进行一个额外的回合。在同一回合中，俊杰左边的牌手离开了游戏，使得回合标记的数目减少。在俊杰当前的回合结束后，他的回合标记被移除。他不会立即进行因时间行走而得到的额外回合，而在他下一次得到回合标记且正常进行回合之前，他先进行该额外回合。   
Example: During Alex’s turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one. During the same turn, the player to Alex’s left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be reduced. After Alex’s current turn ends, his turn marker is removed. He won’t take the extra turn from Time Walk until just before his normal turn the next time he receives a turn marker.

<b id='cr807-5'>807.5.</b> 大型混战玩法的游戏使用多个堆叠，而不是只有一个堆叠。每个回合标记都代表了它自己的堆叠。   
<b>807.5.</b> Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker represents its own stack.

<b id='cr807-5a'>807.5a</b> 只有当一个回合标记在一位牌手的影响范围内，或是属于该回合标记之堆叠中的一个物件之操控者在该牌手的影响范围内时，该牌手才能得到属于此回合标记之堆叠的优先权。   
<b>807.5a</b> A player gets priority for a particular turn marker’s stack only if the turn marker is within their range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.

<b id='cr807-5b'>807.5b</b> 如果一位同时具有多个堆叠优先权的牌手施放了一个咒语、起动了一个异能，或是一个由其操控的触发式异能被触发，则该牌手必须说明该咒语或异能将被放入哪一个堆叠。如果其中一个堆叠上的一个物件将触发触发式异能，则该牌手必须将此触发式异能放入该堆叠。如果其中一个堆叠中上的一个物件导致触发式异能被触发，则该牌手必须将此异能放进该堆叠。如果其中一个堆叠上的一个结算中的咒语或异能令一位牌手施放一个咒语或创造一个咒语的复制，则新的咒语必须被放进同一个堆叠。如果一个咒语或异能指定了其中一个堆叠上的物件，则它必须被放进与其目标相同的堆叠；它不能指定多个堆叠中的物件为目标。   
<b>807.5b</b> If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell, activates an ability, or a triggered ability they control triggers, the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is put on. If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack. If a spell or ability targets an object on one of those stacks, it must be put on the same stack as its target; it can’t target objects on multiple stacks.

<b>808.3b</b> The deploy creatures options and limited range of influence options usually aren’t used in the Team vs. Team variant.

<b id='cr808-4'>808.4.</b> 决定先手牌手时，随机选择一个队伍。如果该队伍的牌手数量为奇数，坐在该队伍正中间的牌手是先手牌手。如果该队伍的牌手数量为偶数，坐在该队伍中点左侧的牌手是先手牌手。回合顺序为自该牌手起向左。   
<b>808.4.</b> To determine which player goes first, randomly choose a team. If that team has an odd number of players, the player in its center seat goes first. If that team has an even number of players, the player to the left of its midpoint goes first. Turn order goes to the players’ left.

<b id='cr808-5'>808.5.</b> 在队伍对队伍玩法中，同一队伍的资源（手牌、法术力等）都不共享。队友可以在任何时候互相检视手牌和讨论策略。队友之间不能操作彼此的牌或永久物。   
<b>808.5.</b> In the Team vs. Team variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.

<b>809.3b</b> Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see rule 804).

<b id='cr809-3c'>809.3c</b> 牌手只能攻击坐在其旁边的对手、坐在其旁边的对手操控的鹏洛客，或是坐在其旁边的对手防卫的战役。   
<b>809.3c</b> A player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to them, a planeswalker controlled by a player seated immediately next to them, or a battle protected by a player seated immediately next to them.

例如：在皇帝玩法的游戏开始时，皇帝不能攻击任何对手，即使对手的将军在其咒语范围内。   
Example: At the start of an Emperor game, neither emperor can attack any opponents, even though both of the opposing generals are within their spell range.

<b id='cr809-4'>809.4.</b> 随机决定由哪位皇帝先手。回合顺序为向牌手左侧进行。

<b>809.6.</b> The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally sized teams. If the teams have more than three players, the range of influence of each player should be adjusted.

<b id='cr809-6a'>809.6a</b> 每位将军的影响范围应为在游戏开始时，一位对手队伍的将军在自己的影响范围之内的最小数值。每位皇帝的影响范围应为在游戏开始时，允许两位对手队伍的将军在自己影响范围之内的最小数值。牌手在排列座位时应保证没有任何皇帝在游戏开始时处于另一位皇帝的影响范围之内。   
<b>809.6a</b> Each general’s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows one general from an opposing team to begin the game within their range of influence. Each emperor’s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows two generals from opposing teams to begin the game within their range of influence. Players should be seated such that no emperor begins the game within the range of influence of another emperor.

<b id='cr810-6'>810.6.</b> 先手队伍略过他们第一个回合的抓牌步骤。   
<b>810.6.</b> The team who plays first skips the draw step of its first turn.

<b id='cr810-7'>810.7.</b> 双头巨人玩法使用队伍共享回合模式的战斗规则（参见规则[805.10](./8#cr805-10)），与一般的战斗规则有所不同。这是对先前规则的改动。   
<b>810.7.</b> The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the combat rules for the shared team turns option (see rule 805.10). This is a change from previous rules.

<b id='cr810-8'>810.8.</b> 双头巨人玩法中使用一般的输赢规则（参见规则[104](./1#cr104)），及以下附加和特定规则。   
<b>810.8.</b> The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule 104), with the following additions and specifications.

<b id='cr810-8a'>810.8a</b> 牌手以队伍赢得或输去游戏，而不是个人。如果队伍中的任一位牌手输去了游戏，整个队伍输去此盘游戏。如果队伍中的任一位牌手赢得了游戏，整个队伍赢得此盘游戏。如果一个效应叙述一位牌手不能赢得游戏，则该牌手所在队伍不会赢得游戏。如果一个效应叙述一位牌手不能输去游戏，则该牌手所在队伍不会输去游戏。   
<b>810.8a</b> Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an effect says that a player can’t win the game, that player’s team can’t win the game. If an effect says that a player can’t lose the game, that player’s team can’t lose the game.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，一位牌手操控超凡入圣，其部分叙述为“你不因总生命为0或更少而输掉此盘游戏。”如果该牌手所在队伍的总生命为0或更少，该队伍也不会输去此盘游戏。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Transcendence, which reads, in part, “You don’t lose the game for having 0 or less life.” If that player’s team’s life total is 0 or less, that team doesn’t lose the game.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，一位牌手在其牌库没有牌时必须抓一张牌。该牌手输去此盘游戏，所以该牌手的队伍亦输去此盘游戏。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player attempts to draw a card while there are no cards in that player’s library. That player loses the game, so that player’s entire team loses the game.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，一位牌手操控白金天使，其叙述为“你这盘游戏不会输，对手也不会赢。”则只要白金天使在战场，该牌手和其队友都不会输去此盘游戏，且对方队伍的牌手也都不会赢得此盘游戏。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Platinum Angel, which reads, “You can’t lose the game and your opponents can’t win the game.” Neither that player nor their teammate can lose the game while Platinum Angel is on the battlefield, and neither player on the opposing team can win the game.

<b id='cr810-8b'>810.8b</b> 如果一位牌手认输，则其队伍立刻离开游戏。该队伍输去此盘游戏。   
<b>810.8b</b> If a player concedes, their team leaves the game immediately. That team loses the game.

<b id='cr810-8c'>810.8c</b> 如果一个队伍的总生命为0或更少，该队伍输去此盘游戏。（此为状态动作。参见规则[704](./7#cr704)。）   
<b>810.8c</b> If a team’s life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)

<b id='cr810-8d'>810.8d</b> 如果一个队伍具有十五个或更多中毒指示物，该队伍输去此盘游戏。（此为状态动作。参见规则[704](./7#cr704)。）   
<b>810.8d</b> If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)

<b id='cr810-9'>810.9.</b> 伤害、失去生命和得到生命会对单独影响每位牌手。其结果对队伍共享总生命生效。   
<b>810.9.</b> Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to the team’s shared life total.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，一位牌手施放天火断空，其叙述为“天火断空对每位牌手造成4点伤害。”则每个队伍都会受到总共8点的伤害。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Flame Rift, which reads, “Flame Rift deals 4 damage to each player.” Each team is dealt a total of 8 damage.

<b id='cr810-9a'>810.9a</b> 如果一个费用或效应需要得知一位牌手单独的总生命数值，则该费用或效应改为使用该队伍的总生命。   
<b>810.9a</b> If a cost or effect needs to know the value of an individual player’s life total, that cost or effect uses the team’s life total instead.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，某队伍的生命为17，其中的一位牌手被永生信标指定为目标，其部分叙述为“将目标牌手的总生命加倍。”该牌手获得17点生命，其队伍的总生命成为34。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 17 life is targeted by Beacon of Immortality, which reads, in part, “Double target player’s life total.” That player gains 17 life, so the team winds up at 34 life.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，一位牌手操控耐力试炼，叙述为“在你的维持开始时，若你的生命为50或更多，你赢得此盘游戏。”的结界。在该牌手的维持开始时，若该牌手的队伍总生命为50或更多，该队伍赢得游戏。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game.” At the beginning of that player’s upkeep, the player’s team wins the game if their team’s life total is 50 or more.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，某队伍的生命为11，其中的一位牌手操控伏击魔，叙述为“支付你的一半生命，小数点后进位：伏击魔成为具飞行异能的4/4惊惧兽生物。”的结界。要起动该异能，该牌手须支付6点生命。队伍的总生命成为5。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 11 life controls Lurking Evil, an enchantment that reads, “Pay half your life, rounded up: Lurking Evil becomes a 4/4 Horror creature with flying.” To activate the ability, that player must pay 6 life. The team winds up at 5 life.

<b id='cr810-9b'>810.9b</b> 如果一个费用或效应允许队伍中的两位牌手同时支付生命，其支付的生命总和不能超过其队伍的总生命。（牌手总是可以支付0点生命。）   
<b>810.9b</b> If a cost or effect allows both members of a team to pay life simultaneously, the total amount of life they pay may not exceed their team’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)

<b id='cr810-9c'>810.9c</b> 如果一个效应将某一位牌手的总生命设为特定数值，该牌手获得或失去相应的生命，使得总生命成为该数值。队伍的总生命根据该牌手所获得或失去的生命而相应调整。   
<b>810.9c</b> If an effect sets a single player’s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total. The team’s life total is adjusted by the amount of life that player gained or lost.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，某队伍的生命为25，其中的一位牌手被一个叙述为“目标牌手的总生命成为10。”的异能指定为目标。该牌手的总生命视为25，因此该牌手失去15点生命。队伍的总生命成为10。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life is targeted by an ability that reads, “Target player’s life total becomes 10.” That player’s life total is considered to be 25, so that player loses 15 life. The team winds up at 10 life.

<b id='cr810-9d'>810.9d</b> 如果一个效应将要设定队伍中的每位牌手之总生命为特定数值，该队伍选择其中一位牌手。在该队伍中，只有该牌手受影响。   
<b>810.9d</b> If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, that team chooses one of its members. On that team, only that player is affected.

例如：在一盘双头巨人游戏中，一个队伍的生命为7，另一个队伍的生命为13。一位牌手施放同法回报，其叙述为“每位牌手的总生命成为所有牌手中总生命最低者的数值。”每个队伍选择其中一位牌手受到其影响。结果是具有13点生命的队伍中所选择的牌手失去6点生命，该队伍的总生命成为7。   
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, one team has 7 life and the other team has 13 life. A player casts Repay in Kind, which reads, “Each player’s life total becomes the lowest life total among all players.” Each team chooses one of its members to be affected. The result is that the chosen player on the team that has 13 life loses 6 life, so that team’s life total winds up at 7.

<b id='cr810-9e'>810.9e</b> 牌手不能与其队友交换总生命。如果效应将造成此种交换，交换不会发生。   
<b>810.9e</b> A player can’t exchange life totals with their teammate. If an effect would cause that to occur, the exchange won’t happen.

<b id='cr810-9f'>810.9f</b> 如果一个效应指示牌手重新分配任意数量的牌手之总生命，每个队伍中只能至多影响一位牌手。   
<b>810.9f</b> If an effect instructs a player to redistribute any number of players’ life totals, that player may not affect more than one member of each team this way.

<b id='cr810-9g'>810.9g</b> 如果一个效应叙述一位牌手不能获得生命，该牌手的队伍中没有牌手可以获得生命。   
<b>810.9g</b> If an effect says that a player can’t gain life, no player on that player’s team can gain life.

<b id='cr810-9h'>810.9h</b> 如果一个效应叙述一位牌手不能失去生命，该牌手的队伍中没有牌手可以失去生命，或支付除0点生命外的任何生命。   
<b>810.9h</b> If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, no player on that player’s team can lose life or pay any amount of life other than 0.

<b id='cr810-10'>810.10.</b> 将使得牌手得到中毒指示物的效应，会个别对牌手发生。中毒指示物由整个队伍共享。   
<b>810.10.</b> Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison counters are shared by the team.

<b id='cr810-10a'>810.10a</b> 如果一个效应需要知道个别牌手所具有的中毒指示物数量，则该效应会采用该牌手队伍的中毒指示物数量。如果一个效应需要知道牌手对手的中毒指示物数量，则该效应会采用对手队伍的中毒指示物数量。   
<b>810.10a</b> If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the number of poison counters that player’s team has. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters a player’s opponents have, that effect uses the number of poison counters opposing teams have.

<b id='cr810-10b'>810.10b</b> 如果一个效应注记着某牌手失去若干中毒指示物，则该牌手的队伍会失去该数量的中毒指示物。   
<b>810.10b</b> If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that player’s team loses that many poison counters.

<b id='cr810-10c'>810.10c</b> 如果一个效应让一位牌手不能得到中毒指示物，该牌手队伍的牌手都不能得到中毒指示物。   
<b>810.10c</b> If an effect says that a player can’t get poison counters, no player on that player’s team can get poison counters.

<b id='cr810-10d'>810.10d</b> 如果一个规则或效应需要得知某位牌手具有的指示物之种类，该效应使用该牌手具有的指示物之种类以及该牌手的队伍具有的指示物之种类。如果牌手的队伍具有一个或数个中毒指示物，该牌手便“已中毒”。   
<b>810.10d</b> If a rule or effect needs to know what kinds of counters an individual player has, that effect uses the kinds of counters that player has and the kinds of counters that player’s team has. A player is “poisoned” if that player’s team has one or more poison counters.

<b id='cr810-11'>810.11.</b> 双头巨人玩法也适用于由两位以上且相同数量牌手组成的队伍之间的游戏。从两位牌手算起，队伍中每多出一位牌手，队伍的起始总生命便增加15，输去游戏所需的中毒指示物便增加5。（这些玩法称为三头巨人或四头巨人，依此类推。）   
<b>810.11.</b> The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players. For each player a team has beyond the second, that team’s starting life total is increased by 15 and the number of poison counters required for the team to lose is increased by five. (These variants are called Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)

## <span id='cr811'>811.</span> 隔位分队玩法 Alternating Teams Variant
<b id='cr811-1'>811.1.</b> 隔位分队玩法可以在两个或更多相等人数的队伍间游戏时使用。   
<b>811.1.</b> Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.

<b id='cr811-2'>811.2.</b> 游戏开始前需要决定使用哪些多人游戏模式。隔位分队玩法会默认使用以下模式。   
<b>811.2.</b> Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the following default options.

<b id='cr811-2a'>811.2a</b> 建议影响范围为2。参见规则[801](./8#cr801)，“限制影响范围模式”。   
<b>811.2a</b> The recommended range of influence is 2. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”

<b id='cr811-2b'>811.2b</b> 必须使用攻击左边、攻击右边，以及攻击复数牌手这三个模式中的一个。参见规则[803](./8#cr803)，“攻击左边或右边模式”，和规则[802](./8#cr802)，“攻击复数牌手模式”。   
<b>811.2b</b> Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”

<b id='cr811-2c'>811.2c</b> 隔位分队玩法中通常不使用调动生物模式。   
<b>811.2c</b> The deploy creatures option isn’t normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.

<b id='cr811-3'>811.3.</b> 于游戏开始时，牌手以如下方式就座：不坐在任何队友旁边，且队友之间的距离相等。   
<b>811.3.</b> At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out.

例如：三个队伍A、B、C之间使用隔位分队玩法进行游戏。于游戏开始时，座位顺序为A1、B1、C1、A2、B2、C2、A3、B3、C3，以此类推。   
Example: In an Alternating Teams game with three teams, A, B, and C, the seating around the table at the start of the game is A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, and so on.

<b id='cr811-4'>811.4.</b> 牌手不能攻击不坐在该牌手旁边的对手、不坐在该牌手旁边的对手操控的鹏洛客，或是不坐在该牌手旁边的对手防卫的战役。   
<b>811.4.</b> A player can’t attack opponents who aren’t seated next to them, planeswalkers that aren’t controlled by opponents seated next to them, or battles that aren’t protected by opponents seated next to them.

<b id='cr811-5'>811.5.</b> 在隔位分队玩法中，同一队伍的资源（手牌、法术力等）都不共享。除非互相坐在旁边，否则队友之间不能互相检视手牌。队友可以在任何时候互相讨论策略。队友之间不能操作彼此的牌或永久物。   
<b>811.5.</b> In the Alternating Teams variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates can’t review each other’s hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.
