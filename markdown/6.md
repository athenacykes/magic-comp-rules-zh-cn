## <span id='cr601'>601.</span> 施放咒语 Casting Spells
<b id='cr601-1'>601.1.</b> 多年以来，施放咒语或作为咒语施放一张牌这个动作，在牌上被称为“使用”该咒语或该牌。以这些用词印刷的卡牌均已经在Oracle牌张参考文献中勘误为“施放”该咒语或该牌。   
<b>601.1.</b> Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as “playing” that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “casting” that spell or that card.

<b id='cr601-1a'>601.1a</b> 一些效应依然“使用”一张牌。“使用一张牌”表示，在作为地使用该牌或作为咒语施放该牌中适当的一项。   
<b>601.1a</b> Some effects still refer to “playing” a card. “Playing a card” means playing that card as a land or casting that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.

<b id='cr601-2'>601.2.</b> 施放咒语指将其从当前区域（通常是手牌）放进堆叠，且支付其费用，从而令它可以在结算时产生效应。施放咒语分为两部分：咒语的声明（规则[601.2a-d](./6#cr601-2a)）和确定及支付费用（规则[601.2f-h](./6#cr601-2f)）。要施放咒语，牌手需依序进行下列步骤。牌手必须在允许合法施放该咒语的情况下才可以开始此流程（参见规则[601.3](./6#cr601-3)）。如果牌手在执行下列任一步骤时无法遵循该步骤的要求，则该咒语的施放非法；游戏倒回至声明施放该咒语之前的时间点（参见规则[730](./7#cr730)，“处理非法动作”）。   
<b>601.2.</b> To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell (rules 601.2a–d) and determination and payment of costs (rules 601.2f–h). To cast a spell, a player follows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process (see rule 601.3). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 730, “Handling Illegal Actions”).

<b id='cr601-2a'>601.2a</b> 要声明施放咒语，该牌手首先将该牌（或该牌的复制）从其现在的区域移到堆叠上。它成为堆叠最顶端的物件。它具有该牌（或该牌复制）给予的所有特征，且该牌手成为其操控者。于你开始施放咒语时修改咒语特征的持续性效应在咒语放进堆叠时起生效（参见规则[611.2f](./6#cr611-2f)）。该咒语直到结算、被反击，或被一个规则或效应转移到其他区域之前一直保持在堆叠中。   
<b>601.2a</b> To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. Any continuous effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as you start casting it begin as it is put on the stack (see rule 611.2f). The spell remains on the stack until it resolves, it’s countered, or a rule or effect moves it elsewhere.

<b id='cr601-2b'>601.2b</b> 如果该咒语具有模式，则该牌手宣告其选择的模式（参见规则[700.2](./7#cr700-2)）。如果该牌手希望将任何牌通联到该咒语上（参见规则[702.47](./7#cr702-47)），他从其手上展示这些牌。如果该咒语具有替代、额外、或其他于施放时支付的特殊费用，如购回或增幅费用（参见规则[118.8](./1#cr118-8)和[118.9](./1#cr118-9)），该牌手宣告其将支付其中任何或全部费用（参见规则[601.2f](./6#cr601-2f)）。牌手不能应用两种替代施放的方式，或对同一个咒语应用两种替代性费用。如果该咒语具有于施放时支付的可变数值费用（比如其法术力费用中包含{X}；参见规则[107.3](./1#cr107-3)），该牌手宣告该可变数值的数值。如果该可变数值的数值在该咒语的叙述中由牌手将在稍后的咒语宣告或结算中作出的选择来定义，该牌手改为在此时作出该选择，而非在该稍后的时间点。如果于该咒语被施放时所支付的一个费用中包含混血法术力符号，该牌手宣告他即将支付的等同于该费用的非混血费用。如果于释放咒语时支付的一个费用中包含非瑞克西亚法术力符号，该牌手宣告他为每个这些符号支付2点生命或支付对应颜色的法术力。在此之前所作出的选择（例如选择从坟墓场中施放具有返照的咒语，或选择用变身面朝下的施放生物）可能会在该牌手作出选择时限制其选项。   
<b>601.2b</b> If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see rule 702.47), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has alternative or additional costs that will be paid as it’s being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see rules 118.8 and 118.9), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule 601.2f). A player can’t apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell. If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as it’s being cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see rule 107.3), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell, that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or a corresponding colored mana cost for each of those symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the player’s options when making these choices.

<b id='cr601-2c'>601.2c</b> 该牌手为咒语要求的每个目标宣告其所选择的相对应的物件或牌手。一个咒语可能只有在一个替代、额外、或特殊费用（例如购回或增幅费用）、或某个模式被选择的情况下才要求一些目标；否则，该咒语被视同不具有这些目标般被施放。类似地，一个咒语可能只有在为其选择了一个替代或额外费用时才要求不同的目标。如果该咒语具有的目标数量为可变数值，该牌手在宣告目标前宣告他将选择多少个目标。在某些情况下，目标的数量会由咒语的叙述定义。一旦该咒语目标的数量被确定，该数量便不会改变，即使用于确定目标数量的信息已经变化。同一个目标不能被咒语上的某一个“目标”一词多次选择。但如果该咒语在多处使用“目标”一词，则同一个物件或牌手可以被每个“目标”一词选择一次（只要它符合目标要求）。如果任何效应要求一个物件或牌手必须被选择为目标，则选择目标的牌手在不违反任何规则或令该物件或牌手不能被选择为目标的效应的前提下，必须尽可能达成最多数量的此类效应。每个被选择的物件和/或牌手成为该咒语的目标。（任何在这些物件和/或牌手成为咒语的目标时触发的异能在此时触发；它们在该咒语完成被施放之前将等待进入堆叠。）   
<b>601.2c</b> The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost) or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spell’s text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesn’t change, even if the information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player can’t be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players become the target of a spell trigger at this point; they’ll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has finished being cast.)

例如：如果一个咒语为“横置两个目标生物”，则同一个目标不能被选择两次；该咒语要求两个不同的合法目标。一个咒语为“消灭目标神器和目标地”，则可以以同一个神器地为目标两次，因为其在多处使用“目标”一词。   
Example: If a spell says “Tap two target creatures,” then the same creature can’t be chosen twice; the spell requires two different legal targets. A spell that says “Destroy target artifact and target land,” however, can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word “target” in multiple places.

<b id='cr601-2d'>601.2d</b> 如果该咒语要求牌手在一个或数个目标之间平分或分配一个效应（例如伤害或指示物），该牌手宣告该分配。这些目标中的每个目标必须至少分配到一个。   
<b>601.2d</b> If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets, the player announces the division. Each of these targets must receive at least one of whatever is being divided.

<b id='cr601-2e'>601.2e</b> 游戏检查所声明的咒语是否能够合法施放。如果所声明的咒语不能合法施放，游戏倒回至声明施放该咒语之前的时间点（参见规则[730](./7#cr730)，“处理非法动作”）。   
<b>601.2e</b> The game checks to see if the proposed spell can legally be cast. If the proposed spell is illegal, the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 730, “Handling Illegal Actions”).

<b id='cr601-2f'>601.2f</b> 该牌手确定该咒语的总费用。这通常只是其法术力费用。一些咒语具有额外或替代性费用。一些效应可能增加或减少须支付的费用，或提供其他的替代性费用。费用可能包括法术力、横置永久物、牺牲永久物、弃牌等。总费用为其法术力费用或替代性费用（于规则[601.2b](./6#cr601-2b)中确定），加上所有额外费用和增加的费用，并减去所有减少的费用。如果有多个减少费用的效应将要生效，该牌手可以以任意顺序生效这些效应。如果总费用的法术力部分被减少费用的效应减至没有，它被视同{0}。它不能被减少至小于{0}。一旦总费用被确定，任何直接影响总费用的效应生效。然后总费用的结果被“锁定”。如果有效应将在此之后改变总费用，它将没有任何效果。   
<b>601.2f</b> The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can’t be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.

<b id='cr601-2g'>601.2g</b> 如果总费用包括支付法术力，则该牌手然后将有机会起动法术力异能（参见规则[605](./6#cr605)，“法术力异能”）。法术力异能必须在支付费用之前被起动。   
<b>601.2g</b> If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, “Mana Abilities”). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.

<b id='cr601-2h'>601.2h</b> 该牌手支付总费用。首先，牌手以任意顺序支付所有不涉及随机元素或将物件从牌库移动到某个公开区域的费用。然后牌手以任意顺序支付所有剩余的费用。不可以只支付部分费用。不能被支付的费用不可支付。   
<b>601.2h</b> The player pays the total cost. First, they pay all costs that don’t involve random elements or moving objects from the library to a public zone, in any order. Then they pay all remaining costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs can’t be paid.

例如：你施放祭坛夺命，其费用为{1}{B}并具有额外费用牺牲一个生物。你牺牲雷景院佣兽，其效应令你的黑色咒语少支付{1}来施放。由于咒语的总费用在真正支付费用之前已经被“锁定”，你支付{B}而不是{1}{B}，即使你牺牲了佣兽。   
Example: You cast Altar’s Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spell’s total cost is “locked in” before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though you’re sacrificing the Familiar.

<b id='cr601-2i'>601.2i</b> 一旦601.2a-h中所叙述的所有步骤均被完成，于咒语施放期间修改其特征的效应生效，然后咒语成为被施放。任何因一个咒语被施放或进入堆叠而触发的异能此时触发。如果咒语的操控者在施放它之前具有优先权，他再次得到优先权。   
<b>601.2i</b> Once the steps described in 601.2a–h are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as it’s cast are applied, then the spell becomes cast. Any abilities that trigger when a spell is cast or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spell’s controller had priority before casting it, they get priority.

<b id='cr601-3'>601.3.</b> 牌手只能在某规则或效应允许牌手施放该咒语、且没有规则或效应禁止该牌手施放该咒语时，才能施放咒语。   
<b>601.3.</b> A player can begin to cast a spell only if a rule or effect allows that player to cast it and no rule or effect prohibits that player from casting it.

<b id='cr601-3a'>601.3a</b> 如果某效应禁止牌手施放具有指定特性的咒语，该牌手可以在声明该咒语期间考虑任何可能导致这些特性改变的选择。如果有此类选择可以使得该效应不再禁止该牌手施放该咒语，该牌手可以开始施放该咒语并忽略该效应。   
<b>601.3a</b> If an effect prohibits a player from casting a spell with certain qualities, that player may consider any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause those qualities to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to no longer prohibit that player from casting that spell, the player may begin to cast the spell, ignoring the effect.

例如：一位牌手操控虚空筛除体，其部分叙述为“所有对手都不能施放法术力值为偶数的咒语。”该牌手的对手可以开始施放旋雷（一张法术力费用为{X}{R}{R}的牌），因为X的选定值可能使得该咒语的法术力值成为奇数。   
Example: A player controls Void Winnower, which reads, in part, “Your opponents can’t cast spells with even mana values.” That player’s opponent may begin to cast Rolling Thunder, a card whose mana cost is {X}{R}{R}, because the chosen value of X may cause the spell’s mana value to become odd.

<b id='cr601-3b'>601.3b</b> 如果某效应允许牌手视同具有闪现异能地来施放具有指定特性的咒语，该牌手可以在声明该咒语期间考虑任何可能导致该咒语特性改变的选择。如果有此类选择可以使得该效应生效，该牌手可以视同其具有闪现异能地开始施放该咒语。   
<b>601.3b</b> If an effect allows a player to cast a spell with certain qualities as though it had flash, that player may consider any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause that spell’s qualities to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to apply, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.

例如：一个效应为“你可以将灵气咒语视同具有闪现异能地来施放。”你手上有一张具有神授异能的生物牌。因为选择支付神授异能的替代性费用使得该咒语成为灵气咒语，你可以合法地开始施放该咒语，如同该咒语具有闪现异能。   
Example: An effect says that you may cast Aura spells as though they had flash, and you have a creature card with bestow in your hand. Because choosing the bestow ability’s alternative cost causes that spell to become an Aura spell, you may legally begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.

<b id='cr601-3c'>601.3c</b> 如果一个效应允许牌手仅当一个替代性费用或额外费用被支付时才能视同其具有闪现异能地施放某咒语，该牌手可以视同其具有闪现异能地开始施放该咒语。   
<b>601.3c</b> If an effect allows a player to cast a spell as though it had flash only if an alternative or additional cost is paid, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.

<b id='cr601-3d'>601.3d</b> 如果一个咒语仅当符合特定条件时才具有闪现，其操控者可以在该条件符合时视同其具有闪现异能地开始施放该咒语。   
<b>601.3d</b> If a spell would have flash only if certain conditions are met, its controller may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash if those conditions are met.

<b id='cr601-3e'>601.3e</b> 一些规则或效应叙述在确定一张牌或一张牌的复制是否可以合法施放时，会考虑它的一组替代特征或其特征的子集。在此次确定中，这些替代特征替换该物件的原特征。一旦该物件具有这些特征便会生效的持续性效应也会被考虑在内。   
<b>601.3e</b> Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics replace the object’s characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that object once it has those characteristics are also considered.

例如：贾路的兽群的部分叙述为“你可以从你的牌库顶施放生物咒语。”如果你操控贾路的兽群，且你的牌库顶牌是一张具有变身异能的非生物牌，你可以使用其变身异能施放之。   
Example: Garruk’s Horde says, in part, “You may cast creature spells from the top of your library.” If you control Garruk’s Horde and the top card of your library is a noncreature card with morph, you may cast it using its morph ability.

例如：伊捷守护者梅列克的部分叙述为“你可以从你的牌库顶施放瞬间和法术咒语。”如果你操控伊捷守护者梅列克，且你的牌库顶牌是巨人杀手（一张历险名为连根砍倒的瞬间之历险者生物牌），你可以施放连根砍倒，但不能施放巨人杀手。倘若此时你操控的不是梅列克、而是贾路的兽群，则你可以从牌库顶施放巨人杀手，而不能施放连根砍倒。   
Example: Melek, Izzet Paragon says, in part, “You may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your library.” If you control Melek, Izzet Paragon and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, an adventurer creature card whose Adventure is an instant named Chop Down, you may cast Chop Down but not Giant Killer. If instead you control Garruk’s Horde and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, you may cast Giant Killer but not Chop Down.

<b id='cr601-3f'>601.3f</b> 一些效应允许牌手从放逐区牌面朝下的牌中施放具某些特性的咒语。仅当牌手被允许检视这些放逐区中牌面朝下的牌时，该牌手才可以开始施放该咒语。   
<b>601.3f</b> Some effects allow a player to cast a spell with certain qualities from among face-down cards in exile. A player may begin to cast such a spell only if they can look at the face-down card in exile.

<b id='cr601-4'>601.4.</b> 在依照规则[601.2b](./6#cr601-2b)所述之流程声明其选择的模式、替代性费用和/或额外费用时，一些选项仅当牌手作出了某些其他选择后才可选，且这些选择依照规则通常在稍后才会作出。在此情形下，该咒语的操控者可将其他选择视为在该步骤中可以作出。如果任何此类选择可以允许牌手选择特定的模式、替代性费用或额外费用，则他可以如此作。   
<b>601.4.</b> While announcing the choices of any modes, alternative costs, and/or additional costs as described in rule 601.2b, some options may be available to a player only if other choices are made that would normally be made later in that rule’s instructions. In that case, the spell’s controller may consider any other choices to be made in that step. If any such choices could allow them to choose a particular mode, alternative cost, or additional cost, they may do so.

例如：丰足铭文是具有模式的咒语，它具有增幅异能，叙述为“选择一项。如果此咒语已增幅，则改为选择任意数量的选项。”当选择该咒语的模式时，其操控者可以选择任意数量的模式，即使在声明过程中选择支付增幅费用通常在稍后才会作出。   
Example: Inscription of Abundance is a modal spell with kicker and the text “Choose one. If this spell was kicked, choose any number instead.” When announcing the chosen modes for the spell, its controller may choose any number of modes, even though choosing to pay the kicker cost is normally done later in the announcement process.

<b id='cr601-5'>601.5.</b> 如果牌手在完成咒语的声明（参见规则[601.2a-d](./6#cr601-2a)）之后不再被允许施放之，则该咒语施放非法，游戏倒回至声明施放该咒语之前的时间点（参见规则[730](./7#cr730)，“处理非法动作”）。如果某规则或效应在确定和支付该咒语的费用时（参见规则[601.2f-h](./6#cr601-2f)）或该咒语的施放完成之后使得该咒语的施放非法，则它没有作用。   
<b>601.5.</b> If a player is no longer allowed to cast a spell after completing its proposal (see rules 601.2a–d), the casting of the spell is illegal and the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 730, “Handling Illegal Actions”). It doesn’t matter if a rule or effect would make the casting of the spell illegal while determining and paying that spell’s costs (see rules 601.2f–h) or any time after the spell has been cast.

<b id='cr601-5a'>601.5a</b> 一旦牌手开始施放某个因特定条件被满足而具有闪现异能（或可视同具有闪现异能地来施放）的咒语（参见规则[601.3d](./6#cr601-3d)），即使该条件不再满足，该牌手仍然可以继续施放该咒语。   
<b>601.5a</b> Once a player has begun casting a spell that had flash because certain conditions were met or that could be cast as though it had flash because certain conditions were met (see 601.3d), they may continue to cast that spell as though it had flash even if those conditions stop being met.

<b id='cr601-6'>601.6.</b> 一些咒语要求其操控者的一位对手于施放过程中作出一般情况下由其操控者作的某些动作，例如选择一个模式或选择目标。在这些情况下，该对手在该咒语的操控者一般情况下作这些动作时相应的作出选择。   
<b>601.6.</b> Some spells specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it’s being cast, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the spell’s controller normally would do so.

<b id='cr601-6a'>601.6a</b> 如果有多于一位对手可以作出此类选择，该咒语的操控者决定哪位对手将作出选择。   
<b>601.6a</b> If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the spell’s controller decides which of those opponents will make the choice.

<b id='cr601-6b'>601.6b</b> 如果该咒语要求其操控者以及另一位牌手于该咒语被施放时同时作某些动作，该咒语的操控者首先作这些动作，然后为另一位牌手。这是规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)的特殊情况。   
<b>601.6b</b> If the spell instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the spell is being cast, the spell’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4.

<b id='cr601-7'>601.7.</b> 施放一个影响费用的咒语不会影响已经在堆叠上的咒语和异能。   
<b>601.7.</b> Casting a spell that alters costs won’t affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.

## <span id='cr602'>602.</span> 起动起动式异能 Activating Activated Abilities
<b id='cr602-1'>602.1.</b> 起动式异能具有费用和效应。其格式为“[费用]：[效应]。[起动限制（如果有的话）]”。   
<b>602.1.</b> Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]”

<b id='cr602-1a'>602.1a</b> 起动费用是冒号（：）前的全部。一个异能的起动费用必须由起动它的牌手支付。   
<b>602.1a</b> The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An ability’s activation cost must be paid by the player who is activating it.

例如：一个异能为“{2}，{T}：你得到1点生命”的起动费用为两点任意类别的法术力以及横置具有此异能的永久物。   
Example: The activation cost of an ability that reads “{2}, {T}: You gain 1 life” is two mana of any type plus tapping the permanent that has the ability.

<b id='cr602-1b'>602.1b</b> 起动式异能中冒号后面的某些文字可能叙述起动该异能时必须遵循的指示。这些文字可能会叙述哪些牌手可以起动该异能，限制牌手何时可以起动该异能，或定义起动费用的某些条件。这些文字不是异能效应的一部分。它在任何时候都生效。如果起动式异能具有任何起动时的指示，它会出现在最后，即在异能的效应之后。   
<b>602.1b</b> Some text after the colon of an activated ability states instructions that must be followed while activating that ability. Such text may state which players can activate that ability, may restrict when a player can activate the ability, or may define some aspect of the activation cost. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions at all times. If an activated ability has any activation instructions, they appear last, after the ability’s effect.

<b id='cr602-1c'>602.1c</b> 起动式异能是唯一一种可以被起动的异能。如果一个物件或规则使用起动一个异能但未能明确表示哪种异能，它必定表示一个起动式异能。   
<b>602.1c</b> An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be activated. If an object or rule refers to activating an ability without specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.

<b id='cr602-1d'>602.1d</b> 多年以来，在牌上被称为“使用”该异能。以这些用词印刷的卡牌均已经在Oracle牌张参考文献中勘误为“起动”该异能。   
<b>602.1d</b> Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as “playing” that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “activating” that ability.

<b id='cr602-2'>602.2.</b> 起动一个异能指将其放进堆叠并支付其费用，导致它最终可以结算并产生其效果。除非一个物件特别注明，否则只有该物件的操控者（或没有操控者的话，其拥有者）可以起动其起动式异能。起动异能须按照顺序完成以下列出的步骤。如果在起动异能的过程之中，牌手不能完成其中任何步骤，该异能为非法起动；游戏倒回至该异能开始起动之前的时刻（参见规则[730](./7#cr730)，“处理非法动作”）。宣告起动和支付费用在之后将不能更改。   
<b>602.2.</b> To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to be activated (see rule 730, “Handling Illegal Actions”). Announcements and payments can’t be altered after they’ve been made.

<b id='cr602-2a'>602.2a</b> 该牌手宣告他将起动该异能。如果一个起动式异能从隐藏区域中被起动，具有该异能的牌将被展示（参见规则[701.16a](./7#cr701-16a)）。该异能将作为非牌物件被放进堆叠。它成为堆叠最顶端的物件。它具有创造它的异能所具有的文字叙述，且不具有任何其他特征。其操控者为起动该异能的牌手。该异能直到被反击、结算，或被一个效应转移到其他区域之前将一直保持留在堆叠上。   
<b>602.2a</b> The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed (see rule 701.16a). That ability is created on the stack as an object that’s not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.

<b id='cr602-2b'>602.2b</b> 起动异能的其余部分与规则[601.2b-i](./6#cr601-2b)中列出的施放咒语部分相同。这些规则对起动一个异能与施放一个咒语相同。与咒语的法术力费用（规则[601.2f](./6#cr601-2f)中引用）对应的为起动式异能的起动费用。   
<b>602.2b</b> The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2b–i. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An activated ability’s analog to a spell’s mana cost (as referenced in rule 601.2f) is its activation cost.

<b id='cr602-3'>602.3.</b> 一些异能要求其操控者的一位对手于起动过程中作出一般情况下由其操控者作的某些动作，例如选择一个模式或选择目标。在这些情况下，该对手在该异能的操控者一般情况下作这些动作时相应的作出选择。   
<b>602.3.</b> Some abilities specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it’s being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the ability’s controller normally would do so.

<b id='cr602-3a'>602.3a</b> 如果有多于一位对手可以作出此类选择，该异能的操控者决定哪位对手将作出选择。   
<b>602.3a</b> If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the ability’s controller decides which of those opponents will make the choice.

<b id='cr602-3b'>602.3b</b> 如果该异能要求其操控者以及另一位牌手于该异能被起动时同时作某些动作，该异能的操控者首先作这些动作，然后为另一位牌手。这是规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)的特殊情况。   
<b>602.3b</b> If the ability instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the ability is being activated, the ability’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4.

<b id='cr602-4'>602.4.</b> 起动一个影响费用的异能不会影响已经在堆叠上的咒语和异能。   
<b>602.4.</b> Activating an ability that alters costs won’t affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.

<b id='cr602-5'>602.5.</b> 牌手不能尝试开始起动一个不允许被起动的异能。   
<b>602.5.</b> A player can’t begin to activate an ability that’s prohibited from being activated.

<b id='cr602-5a'>602.5a</b> 除非一个生物在其操控者最近的一个回合开始时便由其操控，否则该生物具有的起动费用中包含横置符号（{T}）或重置符号（{Q}）的起动式异能不能被起动。对具有敏捷的生物忽略此规则（参见规则[702.10](./7#cr702-10)）。   
<b>602.5a</b> A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol ({T}) or the untap symbol ({Q}) in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control since the start of their most recent turn. Ignore this rule for creatures with haste (see rule 702.10).

<b id='cr602-5b'>602.5b</b> 如果一个起动式异能对于使用具有限制（例如，“每回合只能起动一次”），该限制对该物件持续生效，即使其操控者发生了改变。   
<b>602.5b</b> If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for example, “Activate only once each turn”), the restriction continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.

<b id='cr602-5c'>602.5c</b> 如果一个物件从另一个物件上获取了一个具有使用限制的起动式异能，则该限制只对此从另一个物件上获取的该异能生效。它不对其他相同措词的异能生效。   
<b>602.5c</b> If an object acquires an activated ability with a restriction on its use from another object, that restriction applies only to that ability as acquired from that object. It doesn’t apply to other, identically worded abilities.

<b id='cr602-5d'>602.5d</b> 起动式异能具有“只能于法术时机起动”表示该牌手必须遵从施放法术咒语的时机规则，即使该异能并不是一个法术。该牌手不需要有他可以施放的法术牌。   
<b>602.5d</b> Activated abilities that read “Activate only as a sorcery” mean the player must follow the timing rules for casting a sorcery spell, though the ability isn’t actually a sorcery. The player doesn’t actually need to have a sorcery card that they could cast.

<b id='cr602-5e'>602.5e</b> 起动式异能具有“只能于瞬间时机起动”表示该牌手必须遵从施放瞬间咒语的时机规则，即使该异能并不是一个瞬间。该牌手不需要有他可以施放的瞬间牌。   
<b>602.5e</b> Activated abilities that read “Activate only as an instant” mean the player must follow the timing rules for casting an instant spell, though the ability isn’t actually an instant. The player doesn’t actually need to have an instant card that they could cast.

## <span id='cr603'>603.</span> 处理触发式异能 Handling Triggered Abilities
<b id='cr603-1'>603.1.</b> 触发式异能具有触发条件和效应。其格式为“[当/每当/在][触发条件或事件]，[效应]。[指示（如有的话）]”。   
<b>603.1.</b> Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[When/Whenever/At] [trigger condition or event], [effect]. [Instructions (if any).]”

<b id='cr603-1a'>603.1a</b> 触发式异能可能在其效应之后包含指示。这些指示可能会限制该异能可指定的目标、或叙述其不能被反击。此文字叙述不是该异能效应的一部分。它在该异能在堆叠上时生效。   
<b>603.1a</b> A triggered ability may include instructions after its effects that limit what the ability may target or state that it can’t be countered. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions while the ability is on the stack.

<b id='cr603-2'>603.2.</b> 每当一个游戏事件或游戏状态符合一个触发式异能的触发事件时，该异能自动触发。该异能此时并不会作任何事。   
<b>603.2.</b> Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability’s trigger event, that ability automatically triggers. The ability doesn’t do anything at this point.

<b id='cr603-2a'>603.2a</b> 由于它们不是被施放或起动的，触发式异能即使在不能合法施放咒语或起动异能时也会触发。阻止异能被起动的效应不会影响它们。   
<b>603.2a</b> Because they aren’t cast or activated, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isn’t legal to cast spells and activate abilities. Effects that preclude abilities from being activated don’t affect them.

<b id='cr603-2b'>603.2b</b> 当一个阶段或步骤开始时，所有“在[此阶段或步骤]开始时”触发的异能触发。   
<b>603.2b</b> When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step trigger.

<b id='cr603-2c'>603.2c</b> 触发事件每次只会导致一个触发式异能触发一次。但如果一个事件包含发生多次，则它会反复触发。   
<b>603.2c</b> An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences.

例如：一个永久物具有触发条件为“每当一个地从战场进入坟墓场时，……”的异能，如果有人施放一个消灭所有地的咒语，该异能在该咒语的结算中将因每个被放进坟墓场的地触发一次。   
Example: A permanent has an ability whose trigger condition reads, “Whenever a land is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” If someone casts a spell that destroys all lands, the ability will trigger once for each land put into the graveyard during the spell’s resolution.

<b id='cr603-2d'>603.2d</b> 异能可能会叙述一个触发式异能额外触发数次。在此情形下，应决定该异能触发应当触发多少次（而非仅仅决定其已触发），然后该异能触发等量的次数。叙述一个异能额外触发数次的效应不会反复引发本身，且不会适用于影响异能触发次数的其他效应。   
<b>603.2d</b> An ability may state that a triggered ability triggers additional times. In this case, rather than simply determining that such an ability has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that ability triggers that many times. An effect that states that an ability triggers additional times doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly and doesn’t apply to other effects that affect how many times an ability triggers.

<b id='cr603-2e'>603.2e</b> 一些效应提及物件的触发式异能。此类效应仅指该物件具有的触发式异能，而非任何该物件具有之异能可能创造的延迟触发式异能（参见规则[603.7](./6#cr603-7)）。   
<b>603.2e</b> Some effects refer to a triggered ability of an object. Such effects refer only to triggered abilities the object has, not any delayed triggered abilities (see rule 603.7) that may be created by abilities the object has.

<b id='cr603-2f'>603.2f</b> 一些触发事件使用“成为”一词（例如，“成为被贴附”或“成为被阻挡”）。它们只在所叙述的事件发生时触发；它们不会因为该状态已经存在而触发，或因保持而再次触发。一个当永久物“成为横置”或“成为未横置”而触发的异能不会因为该永久物以该状态进入战场而触发。   
<b>603.2f</b> Some trigger events use the word “becomes” (for example, “becomes attached” or “becomes blocked”). These trigger only at the time the named event happens—they don’t trigger if that state already exists or retrigger if it persists. An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” or “becomes untapped” doesn’t trigger if the permanent enters the battlefield in that state.

例如：一个当永久物“成为横置”而触发的异能，只有在一个已经存在在战场上的永久物的状态从未横置成为横置时才会触发。   
Example: An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” triggers only when the status of a permanent that’s already on the battlefield changes from untapped to tapped.

<b id='cr603-2g'>603.2g</b> 如果一个触发式异能的触发条件符合，但具有该触发式异能的物件不对所有牌手可见，则该异能不会触发。   
<b>603.2g</b> If a triggered ability’s trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered ability is at no time visible to all players, the ability does not trigger.

<b id='cr603-2h'>603.2h</b> 一个异能只有在其触发事件真正发生了的情况下才会触发。一个被防止或被替代的效应不会触发任何异能。   
<b>603.2h</b> An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event that’s prevented or replaced won’t trigger anything.

例如：如果所有的伤害均被防止，则一个因造成伤害而触发的异能不会触发。   
Example: An ability that triggers on damage being dealt won’t trigger if all the damage is prevented.

<b id='cr603-2i'>603.2i</b> 触发式异能具有的指示可能会以“每回合只能如此作一次”结尾。此异能仅当其来源的操控者该回合尚未执行该指示的动作时才会触发。   
<b>603.2i</b> A triggered ability may have an instruction followed by “Do this only once each turn.” This ability triggers only if its source’s controller has not yet taken the indicated action that turn.

<b id='cr603-3'>603.3.</b> 一旦异能触发，其操控者于下一次有牌手将得到优先权时将其作为非牌物件放进堆叠。参见规则[117](./1#cr117)，“时机和优先权”。该异能成为堆叠最顶端的物件。它具有创造它的异能所具有的文字叙述，且不具有任何其他特征。该异能直到被反击、结算或一个效应将其移到其他地方之前将一直保持留在堆叠上。   
<b>603.3.</b> Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object that’s not a card the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.” The ability becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an effect moves it elsewhere.

<b id='cr603-3a'>603.3a</b> 一个触发式异能的操控者为它触发时操控其来源的牌手，除非它是一个延迟触发式异能。确定延迟触发式异能的操控者，参见规则[603.7d-f](./6#cr603-7d)。   
<b>603.3a</b> A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.

<b id='cr603-3b'>603.3b</b> 如果自上一次有牌手得到优先权之后有多个异能触发，这些异能经由以下两步放进堆叠。首先，每位牌手按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序，将他所操控的、且不以另一个异能触发为触发条件的触发式异能以他所选择的任意顺序放进堆叠。（参见规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)。）然后，每位牌手按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序，将他所操控的其余触发式异能以他所选择的任意顺序放进堆叠。然后游戏再次检查和执行状态动作，直到没有需要执行的为止，然后此过程中触发的异能进入堆叠。此过程重复直到没有新的状态动作需要执行且没有异能触发为止。然后对应的牌手得到优先权。   
<b>603.3b</b> If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, the abilities are placed on the stack in a two-part process. First, each player, in APNAP order, puts each triggered ability they control with a trigger condition that isn’t another ability triggering on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule 101.4.) Second, each player, in APNAP order, puts all remaining triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. Then the game once again checks for and performs state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.

<b id='cr603-3c'>603.3c</b> 如果一个触发式异能具有模式，其操控者在将其放进堆叠时宣告所选择的模式。如果其中一个模式将为非法（例如，由于不能选择合法目标），则该模式不能被选择。如果没有模式被选择，该异能从堆叠被移除。（参见规则[700.2](./7#cr700-2)。）   
<b>603.3c</b> If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode choice when putting the ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 700.2.)

<b id='cr603-3d'>603.3d</b> 将触发式异能放进堆叠的其余部分与规则[601.2c-d](./6#cr601-2c)中列出的施放咒语部分相同。如果当触发式异能进入堆叠时需要作出选择，但无法为其作出合法选择，或如果规则或持续性效应将令其非法，则该异能从堆叠中被移除。   
<b>603.3d</b> The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the stack is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2c–d. If a choice is required when the triggered ability goes on the stack but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.

<b id='cr603-4'>603.4.</b> 一个触发式异能的格式可能为“当/每当/在[触发事件]，若[条件]，[效应]”。当该触发事件发生时，该异能检查该条件是否符合。该异能只有在条件符合时才会触发；否则它将没有效果。如果该异能触发，则于其结算时再次检查该条件是否符合。如果该条件此时不再符合，该异能从堆叠中被移除且没有任何效果。注意这将重复检查合法目标。此规则被称为“以‘若’开头的子句”。（“若”一词在牌其他部分的文字叙述中出现则只具有它的一般中文意义；此规则只对在触发条件之后紧接的“若”生效。）   
<b>603.4.</b> A triggered ability may read “When/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].” When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn’t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule. (The word “if” has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an “if” that immediately follows a trigger condition.)

例如：晶角兽君王叙述为，“在你的维持开始时，若你的总生命为40或更多，你便赢得此盘游戏。”于其操控者的维持开始时检查该牌手的总生命。如果该牌手的生命为39或更少，异能不会触发。如果该牌手的生命为40或更多，异能会触发并进入堆叠。于异能结算时，会再次检查该牌手的总生命。如果此时该牌手的生命为39或更少，异能从堆叠中被移除，并没有效果。如果此时该牌手的生命为40或更多，异能结算，该牌手赢得此盘游戏。   
Example: Felidar Sovereign reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 40 or more life, you win the game.” Its controller’s life total is checked as that player’s upkeep begins. If that player has 39 or less life, the ability doesn’t trigger at all. If that player has 40 or more life, the ability triggers and goes on the stack. As the ability resolves, that player’s life total is checked again. If that player has 39 or less life at this time, the ability is removed from the stack and has no effect. If that player has 40 or more life at this time, the ability resolves and that player wins the game.

<b id='cr603-5'>603.5.</b> 一些触发式异能的效应具有可选择性（它们包含“可以”，例如“在你的维持开始时，你可以抓一张牌”）。这些异能在它们触发时进入堆叠，无论其操控者为它作出何种选择。选择在该异能结算时作出。同样，具有“除非”符合某条件或牌手选择作出某个动作而产生效应的触发式异能将正常的进入堆叠；异能的“除非”部分在该异能结算时处理。   
<b>603.5.</b> Some triggered abilities’ effects are optional (they contain “may,” as in “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card”). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the ability’s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves. Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect “unless” something is true or a player chooses to do something will go on the stack normally; the “unless” part of the ability is dealt with when the ability resolves.

<b id='cr603-6'>603.6.</b> 与物件改变区域有关的触发事件被称为“改变区域触发”。很多具有改变区域触发的异能在该物件改变区域之后对该物件作出影响。在结算过程中，这些异能在该物件移动到的区域中寻找该物件。如果该物件在它移动去的区域中无法找到，该异能尝试对该物件作出影响的部分没有任何效果。该异能可能由于该物件从未进入过该区域、由于它在该异能结算之前离开该区域、或由于它所在的区域并不对某牌手公开（例如牌库或对手的手上）而无法找到该物件。（此规则对即使该物件离开该区域并在异能结算之前返回该区域的情况也同样生效。）最常见的改变区域触发为进入战场触发和离开战场触发。   
<b>603.6.</b> Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called “zone-change triggers.” Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponent’s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers.

<b id='cr603-6a'>603.6a</b> 进入战场异能在一个永久物进入战场时触发。它们具有格式“当[此物件]进入战场时，……”或“每当一个[类别]进入战场时，……”。每次一个事件将一个或数个永久物放进战场时，所有在战场上的永久物（包括刚刚进入战场的那些）检查任何符合此事件的进入战场异能。   
<b>603.6a</b> Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. These are written, “When [this object] enters the battlefield, . . . “ or “Whenever a [type] enters the battlefield, . . .” Each time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all permanents on the battlefield (including the newcomers) are checked for any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.

<b id='cr603-6b'>603.6b</b> 改变永久物特征的持续性效应在该永久物在战场上的瞬间便生效（不是之前）。该永久物从未在战场上且具有未被改变的特征。持续性效应在该永久物在战场上之前不会生效（参见规则[603.6d](./6#cr603-6d)）。   
<b>603.6b</b> Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is on the battlefield (and not before then). The permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified characteristics. Continuous effects don’t apply before the permanent is on the battlefield, however (see rule 603.6d).

例如：如果一个效应为“所有地都是生物”且一个地被使用，该效应在该地牌进入战场的一刻便将该地变为生物，所以它将触发当一个生物进入战场所触发的异能。相对的，如果一个效应为“所有生物失去所有异能”且一张具有进入战场异能的生物牌进入战场，该效应将导致它在进入战场的一刻便失去所有异能，所以进入战场异能将不会触发。   
Example: If an effect reads “All lands are creatures” and a land card is played, the effect makes the land card into a creature the moment it enters the battlefield, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a creature enters the battlefield. Conversely, if an effect reads “All creatures lose all abilities” and a creature card with an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability enters the battlefield, that effect will cause it to lose its abilities the moment it enters the battlefield, so the enters-the-battlefield ability won’t trigger.

<b id='cr603-6c'>603.6c</b> 离开战场异能当一个永久物从战场转移到其他区域，或一个已跃回的永久物由于其拥有者离开游戏而离开游戏时触发。它们具有但不只限制于格式“当[此物件]离开战场时，……”或“每当[什么]从战场进入坟墓场时，……”。（参见规则[603.10](./6#cr603-10)。）尝试对一个离开战场的永久物作任何事情的异能只在它进入的第一个区域中检查该牌。当一张牌“从任何地方”进入某个特定区域而触发的异能不被视同离开战场异能，即使该物件被从战场上被放进该区域。   
<b>603.6c</b> Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone, or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but aren’t limited to, “When [this object] leaves the battlefield, . . .” or “Whenever [something] is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” (See also rule 603.10.) An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. An ability that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone “from anywhere” is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.

<b id='cr603-6d'>603.6d</b> 一些永久物具有叙述“[此永久物]进入战场时上面有……”、“于[此永久物]进入战场时，……”或“[此永久物]横置进入战场”。此类叙述为静止式异能，而不是触发式异能；这些效应作为将该永久物放进战场事件的一部分生效。   
<b>603.6d</b> Some permanents have text that reads “[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,” “[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . ,” or “[This permanent] enters the battlefield tapped.” Such text is a static ability—not a triggered ability—whose effect occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent onto the battlefield.

<b id='cr603-6e'>603.6e</b> 一个灵气具有当所结附的永久物离开战场时触发的触发式异能。这些触发式异能可以在其移到的区域中找到该永久物牌成为的新物件；在检查状态动作之后，它们也可以在其拥有者的坟墓场中找到该灵气成为的新物件。参见规则[400.7](./4#cr400-7)。   
<b>603.6e</b> Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving the battlefield. These triggered abilities can find the new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can also find the new object the Aura card became in its owner’s graveyard after state-based actions have been checked. See rule 400.7.

<b id='cr603-7'>603.7.</b> 一个效应可能会创造一个之后作某些事情的延迟触发式异能。一个延迟触发式异能包括“当”、“每当”，或“在”，且该词一般不在异能的开头。   
<b>603.7.</b> An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered ability will contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usually begin the ability.

<b id='cr603-7a'>603.7a</b> 延迟触发式异能由咒语和异能在结算时创造、因替代性效应生效而产生、或因允许牌手执行动作的静止式异能而产生。延迟触发式异能直到被真正创造之前不会触发，即使它的触发事件刚刚发生过。其他之前发生过的事件可能会令该触发事件无法发生。   
<b>603.7a</b> Delayed triggered abilities are created during the resolution of spells or abilities, as the result of a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static ability that allows a player to take an action. A delayed triggered ability won’t trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.

例如：一个效应的部分为“当此生物离开战场时”，但该生物在该咒语或异能结算前便离开了战场。这种情况下，该延迟触发式异能将不会触发。   
Example: Part of an effect reads “When this creature leaves the battlefield,” but the creature in question leaves the battlefield before the spell or ability creating the effect resolves. In this case, the delayed ability never triggers.

例如：如果一个效应为“当此生物成为未横置时”且该生物在此效应结算前便重置，该异能将等待下次该生物重置。   
Example: If an effect reads “When this creature becomes untapped” and the named creature becomes untapped before the effect resolves, the ability waits for the next time that creature untaps.

<b id='cr603-7b'>603.7b</b> 一个延迟触发式异能只会触发一次——即下一次该触发事件发生时，除非它具有一个时限，例如“本回合”。如果该异能的触发事件同时发生多于一次、且该异能没有时限，该延迟触发式异能的操控者选择哪个事件导致该异能触发。   
<b>603.7b</b> A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once—the next time its trigger event occurs—unless it has a stated duration, such as “this turn.” If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the ability doesn’t have a stated duration, the controller of the delayed triggered ability chooses which event causes the ability to trigger.

<b id='cr603-7c'>603.7c</b> 一个引用某物件的延迟触发式异能即使在该物件改变特性后依然会影响该物件。但如果该物件在延迟触发式异能结算时不再在对应的区域，该异能不会影响它。（注意如果该物件离开此区域且返回，它将是一个新的物件且不会受到影响。参见规则[400.7](./4#cr400-7)。）   
<b>603.7c</b> A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at the time the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won’t affect it. (Note that if that object left that zone and then returned, it’s a new object and thus won’t be affected. See rule 400.7.)

例如：一个异能为“在下一个结束步骤开始时，放逐此生物”将放逐该永久物，即使它在下一个结束步骤已经不是生物。但如果该永久物在此之前离开战场，则它没有任何效果。   
Example: An ability that reads “Exile this creature at the beginning of the next end step” will exile the permanent even if it’s no longer a creature during the next end step. However, it won’t do anything if the permanent left the battlefield before then.

<b id='cr603-7d'>603.7d</b> 由咒语创造的延迟触发式异能的来源为该咒语。该延迟触发式异能的操控者与创造它的咒语结算时该咒语的操控者相同。   
<b>603.7d</b> If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it resolved.

<b id='cr603-7e'>603.7e</b> 如果一个起动式或触发式异能创造了延迟触发式异能，则该延迟触发式异能的来源与创造它的异能来源相同。该延迟触发式异能的操控者与创造它的异能结算时该异能的操控者相同。   
<b>603.7e</b> If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved.

<b id='cr603-7f'>603.7f</b> 如果一个静止式异能产生了一个创造延迟触发式异能的替代性效应，该延迟触发式异能的来源是具有该静止式异能的物件。该延迟触发式异能的操控者与在替代性效应生效时该物件的操控者相同。   
<b>603.7f</b> If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement effect was applied.

<b id='cr603-7g'>603.7g</b> 如果一个静止式异能允许牌手执行动作、且如果牌手如此作便创造一个延迟触发式异能，该延迟触发式异能的来源是具有该静止式异能的物件。该延迟触发式异能的操控者与该动作被执行时该物件的操控者相同。   
<b>603.7g</b> If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the action was taken.

<b id='cr603-7h'>603.7h</b> 一个起动或触发式异能可能创造一个延迟触发式异能，该延迟触发式异能会在创造它的异能在一回合中的第若干次结算时触发。在这种情况下，该延迟触发式异能只会在创造它的异能结算适当的次数后创造一次。   
<b>603.7h</b> An activated or triggered ability may create a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the ability that created it has resolved a certain number of times in a turn. In that case, that delayed triggered ability is created only once, during the appropriate resolution of that ability.

<b id='cr603-8'>603.8.</b> 一些触发式异能在游戏状态（例如一位牌手不操控某牌类别的永久物）符合时触发，而不是某事件发生时触发。一旦游戏状态符合这些条件，这些触发式异能触发。它们将在下一次有机会时进入堆叠。这些被称为状态触发。（注意状态触发与状态动作不同。）一个状态触发式异能直到该异能结算、被反击、或因其他原因离开堆叠之前不会再次触发。然后，如果具有该异能的物件依然在相同区域，且游戏状态依然符合起触发条件，该异能将再次触发。   
<b>603.8.</b> Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. They’ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are called state triggers. (Note that state triggers aren’t the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered ability doesn’t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.

例如：一个永久物的异能为“每当你没有手牌时，抓一张牌”。如果其操控者使用其手上的最后一张牌，该异能将触发一次，且在其离开堆叠前不会再次触发。如果其操控者施放咒语“弃掉你的手牌，然后抓等量的牌”，则该异能将在该咒语的结算过程中触发，因为该牌手暂时没有手牌。   
Example: A permanent’s ability reads, “Whenever you have no cards in hand, draw a card.” If its controller plays the last card from their hand, the ability will trigger once and won’t trigger again until it has left the stack. If its controller casts a spell that reads “Discard your hand, then draw that many cards,” the ability will trigger during the spell’s resolution because the player’s hand was momentarily empty.

<b id='cr603-9'>603.9.</b> 一些触发式异能特指当一位牌手输去游戏时触发。这些异能当有牌手输去或离开游戏时触发，无论原因为何，除非该牌手由于平手离开游戏。参见规则[104.3](./1#cr104-3)。   
<b>603.9.</b> Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the result of a draw. See rule 104.3.

<b id='cr603-10'>603.10.</b> 一般情况下，在一个事件之后立即存在的物件会检查该事件是否符合任何触发条件，且此时存在的持续性效应被用来决定触发条件，以及受此事件影响的物件的特征。但有些触发式异能是此规则的例外；游戏需要根据在事件发生前的时刻，这些异能是否存在以及物件的特征，“回溯”来确定这些异能是否触发。此类例外如下：   
<b>603.10.</b> Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are exceptions to this rule; the game “looks back in time” to determine if those abilities trigger, using the existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of exceptions is as follows:

<b id='cr603-10a'>603.10a</b> 一些改变区域的触发式异能需要回溯。此类异能包括离开战场异能、当一张牌离开坟墓场时触发的异能、及当一个所有牌手可见的物件置入手牌或牌库中时触发的异能。   
<b>603.10a</b> Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can see is put into a hand or library.

例如：两个生物、以及一个具有异能“每当一个生物死去时，你获得1点生命”的神器在战场上。有人施放了一个咒语，消灭所有神器、生物和结界。即使该神器与生物同时置入其拥有者的坟墓场，该神器的异能也会触发两次。   
Example: Two creatures are on the battlefield along with an artifact that has the ability “Whenever a creature dies, you gain 1 life.” Someone casts a spell that destroys all artifacts, creatures, and enchantments. The artifact’s ability triggers twice, even though the artifact goes to its owner’s graveyard at the same time as the creatures.

<b id='cr603-10b'>603.10b</b> 当一个永久物跃离时触发的异能需要回溯。   
<b>603.10b</b> Abilities that trigger when a permanent phases out look back in time.

<b id='cr603-10c'>603.10c</b> 当特指一个物件成为未被贴附时触发的异能需要回溯。   
<b>603.10c</b> Abilities that trigger specifically when an object becomes unattached look back in time.

<b id='cr603-10d'>603.10d</b> 当一位牌手失去一个物件的操控权时触发的异能需要回溯。   
<b>603.10d</b> Abilities that trigger when a player loses control of an object look back in time.

<b id='cr603-10e'>603.10e</b> 当一个咒语被反击时触发的异能需要回溯。   
<b>603.10e</b> Abilities that trigger when a spell is countered look back in time.

<b id='cr603-10f'>603.10f</b> 当一位牌手输去游戏时触发的异能需要回溯。   
<b>603.10f</b> Abilities that trigger when a player loses the game look back in time.

<b id='cr603-10g'>603.10g</b> 当一位牌手时空换出一个时空而触发的异能需要回溯。   
<b>603.10g</b> Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks away from a plane look back in time.

<b id='cr603-11'>603.11.</b> 一些物件具有关联于一个或数个触发式异能的静止式异能。（参见规则[607](./6#cr607)，“关联异能”。）此类物件将这些异能连为一段，静止式异能在前，每个与其关联的触发式异能紧接在后。有极少数物件具有将触发条件写在中间而不是开始的触发式异能。   
<b>603.11.</b> Some objects have a static ability that’s linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by each triggered ability that’s linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.

例如：一个异能为“展示你每回合抓的第一张牌。每当你以此法展示一张基本地牌，抓一张牌”是一个关联于触发式异能的静止式异能。   
Example: An ability that reads “Reveal the first card you draw each turn. Whenever you reveal a basic land card this way, draw a card” is a static ability linked to a triggered ability.

<b id='cr603-12'>603.12.</b> 一个结算中的咒语或异能可能会允许或指示牌手作某动作并创造一个触发式异能，“当[牌手][作或不作]”该动作时，或“当以此法[发生某事]时”触发。此类自身触发式异能遵循延迟触发式异能的规则（参见规则[603.7](./6#cr603-7)），惟下列一点除外：此类异能在被创造后就会立即检查其触发事件在创造该异能的咒语或异能先前的结算过程中是否发生。   
<b>603.12.</b> A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] [does or doesn’t]” take that action or “when [something happens] this way.” These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule 603.7), except that they’re checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.

例如：穿心蝎狮具有异能叙述为“当穿心蝎狮进战场时，你可以牺牲另一个生物。当你如此作时，穿心蝎狮对任意一个目标造成伤害，其数量等同于所牺牲生物的力量。”该自身触发式异能仅当你因为原触发式异能牺牲另一个生物而触发，且不会因为任何其他原因牺牲生物而触发。   
Example: Heart-Piercer Manticore has an ability that reads “When Heart-Piercer Manticore enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, Heart-Piercer Manticore deals damage equal to that creature’s power to any target.” The reflexive triggered ability triggers only when you sacrifice another creature due to the original triggered ability, and not if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.

<b id='cr603-12a'>603.12a</b> 通常，如果触发事件在创造该事件的咒语或异能结算期间多次发生，该自身触发式异能会因每次事件发生各触发一次。但是，如果结算中的咒语或异能包含一个支付某费用“任意次数”的选择，并创造一个触发式异能“当[牌手]支付一次或数次[该费用]时”触发，支付一次或数次该费用仅会使该自身触发式异能触发一次。   
<b>603.12a</b> Normally, if the trigger event or events occur multiple times during the resolution of the spell or ability that created it, the reflexive triggered ability will trigger once for each of those times. However, if a resolving spell or ability includes a choice to pay a cost “any number of times” and creates a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] pays [that cost] one or more times,” paying that cost one or more times causes the reflexive triggered ability to trigger only once.

## <span id='cr604'>604.</span> 处理静止式异能 Handling Static Abilities
<b id='cr604-1'>604.1.</b> 静止式异能一直有效，而不是被起动或触发。它们被表示为叙述形式，且为正确的。   
<b>604.1.</b> Static abilities do something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written as statements, and they’re simply true.

<b id='cr604-2'>604.2.</b> 静止式异能创造持续性效应，其中一些为防止性效应或替代性效应。只要具有该异能的永久物保留在战场上且依然保有该异能，或只要具有该异能的物件依然保留在对应的区域，这些异能便生效，如规则[113.6](./1#cr113-6)中叙述。   
<b>604.2.</b> Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone, as described in rule 113.6.

<b id='cr604-3'>604.3.</b> 一些静止式异能为特征定义异能。特征定义异能表达一个物件的特性，该特性一般可在该物件的其他地方找到（例如其法术力费用、类别栏、或力量/防御力）。特征定义异能可以附加到或覆盖在该物件的其他地方找到的信息。特征定义异能在所有区域生效。它们在游戏外及游戏开始前也依然生效。   
<b>604.3.</b> Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities. A characteristic-defining ability conveys information about an object’s characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that object (such as in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box). Characteristic-defining abilities can add to or override information found elsewhere on that object. Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones. They also function outside the game and before the game begins.

<b id='cr604-3a'>604.3a</b> 一个静止式异能在符合以下条件时为特征定义异能：（1）它定义一个物件的颜色、副类别、力量、或防御力；（2）它印在受其影响的牌上、它由派出衍生物的效应赋予受其影响的衍生物、或作为复制效应或叙述更改效应的结果赋予受其影响的物件；（3）它不直接影响其他物件的特征；（4）它不是一个物件赋予自己的异能；以及（5）它不仅仅在符合某条件时才设定特征。   
<b>604.3a</b> A static ability is a characteristic-defining ability if it meets the following criteria: (1) It defines an object’s colors, subtypes, power, or toughness; (2) it is printed on the card it affects, it was granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or it was acquired by the object it affects as the result of a copy effect or text-changing effect; (3) it does not directly affect the characteristics of any other objects; (4) it is not an ability that an object grants to itself; and (5) it does not set the values of such characteristics only if certain conditions are met.

<b id='cr604-4'>604.4.</b> 很多灵气、武具以及工事都具有影响其贴附物件的静止式异能，但这些异能不指定该物件为目标。如果一个灵气、武具或工事被转移到不同的物件上，该异能不再对原来的物件生效，而是开始影响新的物件。   
<b>604.4.</b> Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that modify the object they’re attached to, but those abilities don’t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.

<b id='cr604-5'>604.5.</b> 一些静止式异能于咒语在堆叠期间有效。这些经常为提及反击该咒语的异能。另外，“作为施放……的额外费用”、“你可以支付[费用]而不是支付[此物件]的法术力费用”、以及“你可以不支付其法术力来施放[此物件]”的异能均于该咒语在堆叠期间生效。   
<b>604.5.</b> Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to countering the spell. Also, abilities that say “As an additional cost to cast . . . ,” “You may pay [cost] rather than pay [this object]’s mana cost,” and “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost” work while a spell is on the stack.

<b id='cr604-6'>604.6.</b> 一些静止式异能于该牌在任何你可以施放或使用它的区域内生效（一般为你的手上）。这些异能只限制于“你可以[施放/使用][此牌]……”、“你不能[施放/使用][此牌]……”、以及“只有在……的情况下[施放/使用][此牌]”。   
<b>604.6.</b> Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could cast or play it from (usually your hand). These are limited to those that read, “You may [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” “You can’t [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” and “[Cast/Play] [this card] only . . . .”

<b id='cr604-7'>604.7.</b> 与咒语及其他类别的异能不同，静止式异能不使用一个物件的最后已知信息来决定它们的效应如何生效。   
<b>604.7.</b> Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities can’t use an object’s last known information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied.

## <span id='cr605'>605.</span> 法术力异能 Mana Abilities
<b id='cr605-1'>605.1.</b> 一些起动式异能和一些触发式异能为法术力异能，它们遵从特殊的规则。只有符合以下两者之一的异能为法术力异能，无论它们还产生何种其他效应或可能有的时机限制（例如“只能于瞬间时机起动”）。   
<b>605.1.</b> Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities, which are subject to special rules. Only abilities that meet either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities, regardless of what other effects they may generate or what timing restrictions (such as “Activate only as an instant”) they may have.

<b id='cr605-1a'>605.1a</b> 如果一个起动式异能符合以下所有条件，则它属于法术力异能：不需要目标（参见规则[115.6](./1#cr115-6)）、在结算时可以加法术力到牌手的法术力池中、且它不是忠诚异能。（参见规则[606](./6#cr606)，“忠诚异能”。）   
<b>605.1a</b> An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule 115.6), it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves, and it’s not a loyalty ability. (See rule 606, “Loyalty Abilities.”)

<b id='cr605-1b'>605.1b</b> 如果一个触发式异能符合以下所有条件，则它属于法术力异能：不需要目标（参见规则[115.6](./1#cr115-6)）、因起动式法术力异能的起动或结算、或因法术力加到牌手的法术力池中而触发（参见规则[605.1a](./6#cr605-1a)）、且在结算时可以加法术力到牌手的法术力池中。   
<b>605.1b</b> A triggered ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule 115.6), it triggers from the activation or resolution of an activated mana ability (see rule 605.1a) or from mana being added to a player’s mana pool, and it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves.

<b id='cr605-2'>605.2.</b> 一个法术力异能即使在游戏状态不允许其产生法术力的情况下依然为法术力异能。   
<b>605.2.</b> A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesn’t allow it to produce mana.

例如：一个永久物具有异能“{T}：你每操控一个生物便加{G}”。即使你不操控任何生物或该永久物已经被横置，此异能依然是法术力异能。   
Example: A permanent has an ability that reads “{T}: Add {G} for each creature you control.” The ability is still a mana ability even if you control no creatures or if the permanent is already tapped.

<b id='cr605-3'>605.3.</b> 起动一个起动式法术力异能遵从起动任何其他起动式异能的规则（参见规则[602.2](./6#cr602-2)），但包括以下特例：   
<b>605.3.</b> Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for activating any other activated ability (see rule 602.2), with the following exceptions:

<b id='cr605-3a'>605.3a</b> 每当牌手持有优先权时、每当他施放一个要求支付法术力的咒语或起动一个要求支付法术力的异能时、或每当规则或效应要求支付法术力，即使处于施放或结算咒语/起动或结算异能的中途时，牌手可以起动一个起动式法术力异能。   
<b>605.3a</b> A player may activate an activated mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment, even if it’s in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability.

<b id='cr605-3b'>605.3b</b> 一个起动式法术力异能不进入堆叠，所以它不能被目标、反击、或被响应。它在起动之后马上结算。（参见规则[405.6c](./4#cr405-6c)。）   
<b>605.3b</b> An activated mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after it is activated. (See rule 405.6c.)

<b id='cr605-3c'>605.3c</b> 一旦牌手开始起动一个法术力异能，直到该异能结算为止，该异能不能再次被起动。   
<b>605.3c</b> Once a player begins to activate a mana ability, that ability can’t be activated again until it has resolved.

<b id='cr605-4'>605.4.</b> 触发式法术力异能遵从任何其他触发式异能的规则（参见规则[603](./6#cr603)，“处理触发式异能”），但包括以下特例：   
<b>605.4.</b> Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered abilities (see rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities”), with the following exception:

<b id='cr605-4a'>605.4a</b> 一个触发式法术力异能不进入堆叠，所以它不能被目标、反击、或被响应。它在触发它的法术力异能之后马上结算，而不等待优先权。   
<b>605.4a</b> A triggered mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after the mana ability that triggered it, without waiting for priority.

例如：一个结界具有“每当牌手横置一个地以产生法术力时，该牌手加一点法术力，其类别为该地刚才已产生之类别。”。如果某牌手在施放咒语的过程中横置地产生法术力，他会立即加该额外的法术力，且可以被用来支付该咒语。   
Example: An enchantment reads, “Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of any type that land produced.” If a player taps lands for mana while casting a spell, the additional mana is added immediately and can be used to pay for the spell.

<b id='cr605-5'>605.5.</b> 咒语以及不符合规则[605.1a-b](./6#cr605-1a)所列出情况的异能不是法术力异能。   
<b>605.5.</b> Abilities that don’t meet the criteria specified in rules 605.1a–b and spells aren’t mana abilities.

<b id='cr605-5a'>605.5a</b> 一个具有目标的异能不是法术力异能，即使它在结算时可以将法术力加进牌手的法术力池中。一个产生法术力但不是因为起动法术力异能而触发的触发式异能，或由起动法术力异能而触发但不产生法术力的触发式异能，同样不是法术力异能。它们相应的遵从一般起动式或触发式异能的规则。   
<b>605.5a</b> An ability with a target is not a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. The same is true for a triggered ability that could produce mana but triggers from an event other than activating a mana ability, or a triggered ability that triggers from activating a mana ability but couldn’t produce mana. These follow the normal rules for activated or triggered abilities, as appropriate.

<b id='cr605-5b'>605.5b</b> 咒语永远不会是法术力异能，即使它在结算时将法术力放进牌手的法术力池中。它与其他咒语一样地施放和结算。一些早先版本的牌印有牌类别“法术力源”；这些牌均已经在Oracle牌张参考文献中勘误为瞬间。   
<b>605.5b</b> A spell can never be a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. It’s cast and resolves just like any other spell. Some older cards were printed with the card type “mana source”; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference and are now instants.

## <span id='cr606'>606.</span> 忠诚异能 Loyalty Abilities
<b id='cr606-1'>606.1.</b> 一些起动式异能为忠诚异能，它们遵从特殊规则。   
<b>606.1.</b> Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities, which are subject to special rules.

<b id='cr606-2'>606.2.</b> 在费用中包含忠诚符号的起动式异能为忠诚异能。一般情况下，只有鹏洛客具有忠诚异能。   
<b>606.2.</b> An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Normally, only planeswalkers have loyalty abilities.

<b id='cr606-3'>606.3.</b> 在牌手回合的行动阶段且堆叠为空时，该牌手可以随时在他具有优先权时起动其所操控的某个永久物的一个忠诚异能，但只有在该永久物本回合没有起动过任何忠诚异能的前提下。   
<b>606.3.</b> A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn.

<b id='cr606-4'>606.4.</b> 起动一个忠诚异能的费用为该永久物放上或从该永久物移去一定数量的忠诚指示物，如该异能费用中的忠诚符号所示。此费用可被其他效应影响。   
<b>606.4.</b> The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on or remove from that permanent a certain number of loyalty counters, as shown by the loyalty symbol in the ability’s cost. This cost may be modified by other effects.

<b id='cr606-5'>606.5.</b> 如果起动一个忠诚异能的总费用包含多个增加或移去忠诚指示物的费用，这些费用组合成为一个单一的增加或移去忠诚指示物的费用。   
<b>606.5.</b> If the total cost to activate a loyalty ability contains multiple costs to add or remove loyalty counters, those costs are combined into a single cost to add or remove loyalty counters, as appropriate.

例如：牌手操控卡萨恩隆，其部分叙述为“你起动之由鹏洛客具有的忠诚异能须额外支付[+1]来起动。”该牌手同时操控一个具有三个忠诚指示物的鹏洛客。要起动该鹏洛客通常费用为[+1]的异能，该牌手在其上放置两个忠诚指示物。要起动该鹏洛客通常费用为[-4]的异能，该牌手从其上移去三个忠诚指示物。   
Example: A player controls Carth the Lion, which says, in part, “Planeswalkers’ loyalty abilities you control cost an additional [+1] to activate. That player also controls a planeswalker with three loyalty counters. To activate one of that planeswalker’s abilities that normally costs [+1], they put two loyalty counters on it. To activate one of its abilities that normally costs [−4], they remove three loyalty counters from it.

<b id='cr606-6'>606.6.</b> 除非该永久物具有至少等量的忠诚指示物，否则其具有负数忠诚费用（在计算所有额外费用之后）的忠诚异能不能被起动。   
<b>606.6.</b> A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost, taking into account any additional costs, can’t be activated unless the permanent has at least that many loyalty counters on it.

## <span id='cr607'>607.</span> 关联异能 Linked Abilities
<b id='cr607-1'>607.1.</b> 一个物件可能印有两个异能，其中一个导致作出动作或受影响的物件或牌手，而另一个直接提及这些动作、物件或牌手。在此情况下，这两个异能互相关联：第二个异能仅指第一个异能作出的动作或影响的物件或牌手，而不是任何其他异能。   
<b>607.1.</b> An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them causes actions to be taken or objects or players to be affected and the other one directly refers to those actions, objects, or players. If so, these two abilities are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects or players that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.

<b id='cr607-1a'>607.1a</b> 一个印在另一个异能中且被给予该物件的异能，在此情况下被认为印在该物件上。   
<b>607.1a</b> An ability printed on an object within another ability that grants that ability to that object is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes.

<b id='cr607-1b'>607.1b</b> 一个印在转化式双面牌（参见规则[712](./7#cr712)）的任一牌面上的异能，无论其哪一牌面朝上，在此情况下都被认为印在该物件上。   
<b>607.1b</b> An ability printed on either face of a transforming double-faced card (see rule 712) is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes, regardless of which face is up.

<b id='cr607-1c'>607.1c</b> 一个物件上印的异能如果符合规则[607.1](./6#cr607-1)中叙述的全部两种情况，则它与自己相关联。   
<b>607.1c</b> An ability printed on an object that fulfills both criteria described in rule 607.1 is linked to itself.

<b id='cr607-1d'>607.1d</b> 如果一个物件是衍生物、徽记或非衍生物的永久物，而另一个物件是派出该衍生物或徽记，或将该非衍生物的永久物放进战场的异能之来源，则印刷在这两个物件上的异能可以互相关联。在此情形下，这些异能符合规则[607.2](./6#cr607-2)中所列出的数种关联异能条件中的一种，其区别仅在于印刷在两个物件上而非一个。   
<b>607.1d</b> Abilities printed on two objects can be linked if one object is a token, emblem, or nontoken permanent and the second object was the source of the ability that either created the token or emblem or put that nontoken permanent onto the battlefield. In these cases, the abilities fit the criteria listed for one of the different kinds of linked abilities in rule 607.2 except they are printed on two objects rather than one.

<b id='cr607-2'>607.2.</b> 关联异能有很多种。   
<b>607.2.</b> There are different kinds of linked abilities.

<b id='cr607-2a'>607.2a</b> 如果一个物件印有放逐牌的起动式或触发式异能，且印有的另一个异能提及“该被放逐的牌”或“被[此物件]放逐”的牌，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指放逐区中因第一个异能的结果放于此区的牌。   
<b>607.2a</b> If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that instructs a player to exile one or more cards and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a result of an instruction to exile them in the first ability.

<b id='cr607-2b'>607.2b</b> 如果一个物件印有的异能产生放逐牌的替代性效应，且印有另一个异能提及“该被放逐的牌”或“被[此物件]放逐”的牌，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指放逐区中因第一个异能创造的替代性效应的直接结果放于此区的牌。参见规则[614](./6#cr614)，“替代性效应”。   
<b>607.2b</b> If an object has an ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of a replacement event caused by the first ability. See rule 614, “Replacement Effects.”

<b id='cr607-2c'>607.2c</b> 如果一个物件印有将物件放进战场的起动式或触发式异能，且印有另一个异能提及“由[此物件]放进战场”或“由[此物件]派出”的物件，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指因第一个异能的结果放进战场的物件。   
<b>607.2c</b> If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that puts one or more objects onto the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to objects “put onto the battlefield with [this object]” or “created with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to objects put onto the battlefield as a result of the first.

<b id='cr607-2d'>607.2d</b> 如果一个物件印有令一位牌手“选择一个[数值]”，且印有另一个异能提及“被选择的[数值]”、“最后选择的[数值]”或类似之叙述，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指因第一个异能的结果而作出的选择。   
<b>607.2d</b> If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to “choose a [value]” and an ability printed on it that refers to “the chosen [value],” “the last chosen [value],” or similar, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.

<b id='cr607-2e'>607.2e</b> 如果一个物件印有一个允许一些信息被记下的异能，和另一个提及该物件所记下信息的异能，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指因第一个异能的结果而记下的信息。   
<b>607.2e</b> If an object has an ability printed on it that allows some information to be noted and another ability which refers to information noted for that object, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to information noted as a result of the first ability.

<b id='cr607-2f'>607.2f</b> 如果一个物件印有令一位牌手从两个或更多词中作选择、且这些词在其他情况下没有规则含义的异能，且印有另一个异能提及一个或数个被选择的词，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指因第一个异能的结果而作出的选择。   
<b>607.2f</b> If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to choose from between two or more words that otherwise have no rules meaning and an ability printed on it that refers to a choice involving one or more of those words, those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.

<b id='cr607-2g'>607.2g</b> 如果一个物件印有令一位牌手在其进入战场时支付费用的异能，且印有另一个异能提及“于[此物件]进入战场时”支付的费用，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指因第一个异能的结果而支付的费用。   
<b>607.2g</b> If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a cost as it enters the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] entered the battlefield,” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a cost paid as a result of the first ability.

<b id='cr607-2h'>607.2h</b> 如果一个物件在同一段落中印有一个静止式异能和一个或数个触发式异能，每个触发式异能都与该静止式异能互相关联。每个触发式异能仅指因该静止式异能的结果作出的动作。参见规则[603.11](./6#cr603-11)。   
<b>607.2h</b> If an object has both a static ability and one or more triggered abilities printed on it in the same paragraph, each of those triggered abilities is linked to the static ability. Each triggered ability refers only to actions taken as a result of the static ability. See rule 603.11.

<b id='cr607-2i'>607.2i</b> 如果一个物件印有一个允许支付额外费用的异能，且印有的另一个提及该物件是否支付过此费用，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指作为咒语施放此物件时，是否要支付第一个异能中列出的额外费用。如果一个异能列有多个此类费用，它可能与多个异能互相关联。它们中的每个异能都将明确提及哪一个费用。   
<b>607.2i</b> If an object has an ability printed on it that allows an additional cost to be paid and an ability printed on it that refers to whether that cost was paid, those abilities are linked. The second refers only to whether the intent to pay the additional cost listed in the first was declared as the object was cast as a spell. If an ability lists multiple such costs, it may have multiple abilities linked to it. Each of those abilities will specify which cost it refers to.

例如：岚景院战法术师具有异能“增幅{W}和／或{2}{B}”，以及两个当它进战场时可能触发的异能。若曾以{W}增幅之，第一个异能触发，若曾以{2}{B}增幅之，第二个异能触发。这两个触发式异能分别与其增幅异能相关联。   
Example: Stormscape Battlemage has “Kicker {W} and/or {2}{B}” and two abilities that may trigger when it enters the battlefield. The first triggers if it was kicked with its {W} kicker, and the second triggers if it was kicked with its {2}{B} kicker. Each of those triggered abilities is linked to its kicker ability.

<b id='cr607-2j'>607.2j</b> 如果一个物件印有令一位牌手在该物件施放时支付某个可变数值额外费用的异能，且印有另一个异能提及“于[此物件]施放时”支付的费用，这些异能互相关联。第二个异能仅指在第一个异能中列出并在该物件作为咒语施放时所选定的费用。参见规则[601.2b](./6#cr601-2b)。   
<b>607.2j</b> If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a variable additional cost as it’s cast and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] was cast,” these abilities are linked. The second refers only to the value chosen for the cost listed in the first as the object was cast as a spell. See rule 601.2b.

<b id='cr607-2k'>607.2k</b> 由关键字夺冠代表的两个异能互相关联。参见规则[702.72](./7#cr702-72)，“夺冠”。   
<b>607.2k</b> The two abilities represented by the champion keyword are linked abilities. See rule 702.72, “Champion.”

<b id='cr607-2m'>607.2m</b> 由锚定词开头的异能与允许牌手选择该锚定词的异能互相关联。参见规则[614.12b](./6#cr614-12b)。   
<b>607.2m</b> Abilities preceded by an anchor word are linked to the ability that allows a player to choose that anchor word. See rule 614.12b.

<b id='cr607-2n'>607.2n</b> 如果一个物件印有一个允许牌手“于你将你的套牌洗牌准备开始游戏前”放逐一张或数张牌的静止式异能，和一个提及“以名称为[此物件的名称]之牌放逐”之牌的异能，后者异能与任何于游戏开始前具有该名称之物件所具有的前者异能互相关联。   
<b>607.2n</b> If an object has a static ability printed on it that allows a player to exile one or more cards “before you shuffle your deck to start the game” and an ability printed on it that refers to cards “exiled with cards named [this object’s name],” the second ability is linked to the first ability of any objects that had the specified name before the game began.

<b id='cr607-2p'>607.2p</b> 如果一个物件具有一个使牌手在游戏开始前为一个特征定义异能作出选择的静止式异能，以及一个与该异能印在同一段落的特征定义异能，这些异能互相关联。后者异能仅提及因前者异能之故作出的选择，且游戏进行过程中在该物件改变区域后仍持续提及该选择。   
<b>607.2p</b> If an object has both a static ability that causes a player to make a choice for a characteristic-defining ability before the game begins and that characteristic-defining ability printed on it in the same paragraph, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to the choice made as a result of the first ability and continues to refer to that choice as the object changes zones during the game.

<b id='cr607-2q'>607.2q</b> 如果一个永久物咒语印有一个允许在支付费用以施放它时放逐一张或数张牌的异能，且该咒语所成的永久物具有提及“以[此物件]放逐的牌”，这些异能互相关联。后者异能仅提及支付成为该永久物的咒语之费用时所放逐的牌。   
<b>607.2q</b> If a permanent spell has an ability printed on it that allows one or more cards to be exiled while paying a cost to cast it and the permanent that spell becomes has an ability that refers to cards “exiled with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards exiled to pay the cost of the spell that became that permanent.

<b id='cr607-3'>607.3.</b> 如果一对关联异能中，其中一个异能用“被放逐的牌”、“被[此牌]放逐的牌”或类似用词形容一个单一物件，而另一个异能放逐了多张牌（一般是因为它被复制了），则该异能指代这些被放逐的牌中的每张牌。如果该异能询问被放逐牌的任何信息，例如特征或法术力值，它将得到多个答案。如果这些答案用来确定一个可变数值的值，使用这些答案之加总。如果该异能对“该”牌执行任何动作，则它将对这些被放逐的牌中的每张牌执行该动作。如果该异能派出一个为“该”牌的复制的衍生物，则对于这些被放逐的牌中的每张牌而言，该异能派出一个为该牌的复制的衍生物。如果该异能对“一张”牌执行任何动作，该异能的操控者选择哪张牌会受其影响。   
<b>607.3.</b> If, within a pair of linked abilities, one ability refers to a single object as “the exiled card,” “a card exiled with [this card],” or a similar phrase, and the other ability has exiled multiple cards (usually because it was copied), the ability refers to each of the exiled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the exiled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each exiled card. If that ability creates a token that is a copy of “the” card, then for each exiled card, it creates a token that is a copy of that card. If that ability performs any actions on “a” card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.

<b id='cr607-4'>607.4.</b> 一个异能可能参与一对以上的关联异能。   
<b>607.4.</b> An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.

例如：天堂羽饰具有以下三个异能：“于天堂羽饰进入战场时，选择一个颜色”、“每当一位牌手施放一个所选择颜色的咒语时，你得到1点生命”，以及“{T}：加一点所选择颜色的法术力”。第一个和第二个异能互相关联。第一个和第三个异能也互相关联。   
Example: Paradise Plume has the following three abilities: “As Paradise Plume enters the battlefield, choose a color,” “Whenever a player casts a spell of the chosen color, you may gain 1 life,” and “{T}: Add one mana of the chosen color.” The first and second abilities are linked. The first and third abilities are linked.

<b id='cr607-5'>607.5.</b> 如果一个物件在同一个效应中需要一对关联异能，这些异能将在该物件上互相关联，即使它们没有被印在该物件上。它们不能与其他异能关联，无论该物件此时或之前有过什么异能。   
<b>607.5.</b> If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same effect, the abilities will be similarly linked to one another on that object even though they weren’t printed on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past.

例如：电弧匍行兽具有异能“{R}，放逐你牌库顶的十张牌：电弧匍行兽对任意一个目标造成2点伤害。”石化眼姊妹具有异能“{B}{G}：放逐目标阻挡石化眼姊妹，或被石化眼姊妹阻挡的生物”以及异能“{2}{B}：将一张被石化眼姊妹放逐的生物牌在你的操控下放进战场。”水银元素具有异能“{U}：水银元素获得目标生物的所有起动式异能直到回合结束。”如果牌手用水银元素获得电弧匍行兽的异能，起动该异能，然后令水银元素获得石化眼姊妹的异能，起动该放逐异能且然后起动放回战场的异能，只有水银元素使用石化眼姊妹的异能所放逐的生物牌可以被移回战场上。水银元素用电弧匍行兽的异能放逐的生物牌不能被移回。   
Example: Arc-Slogger has the ability “{R}, Exile the top ten cards of your library: Arc-Slogger deals 2 damage to any target.” Sisters of Stone Death has the ability “{B}{G}: Exile target creature blocking or blocked by Sisters of Stone Death” and the ability “{2}{B}: Put a creature card exiled with Sisters of Stone Death onto the battlefield under your control.” Quicksilver Elemental has the ability “{U}: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of target creature until end of turn.” If a player has Quicksilver Elemental gain Arc-Slogger’s ability, activates it, then has Quicksilver Elemental gain Sisters of Stone Death’s abilities, activates the exile ability, and then activates the return-to-the-battlefield ability, only the creature card Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Sisters of Stone Death’s ability can be returned to the battlefield. Creature cards Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Arc-Slogger’s ability can’t be returned.

<b id='cr607-5a'>607.5a</b> 如果一个物件获得了一个提及选择的异能，但（a）并未同时复制与该异能相关联的异能，或（b）复制了与之关联的异能但并未为此关联异能作出过选择，则将此选择视同“未定义”。如果一个异能提及未定义的选择，异能的该部分将没有任何效果。   
<b>607.5a</b> If an object gains an ability that refers to a choice, but either (a) doesn’t copy that ability’s linked ability or (b) does copy the linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered to be “undefined.” If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part of the ability won’t do anything.

例如：万物使者进入战场，且不稳定变形兽成为其复制。万物使者具有“于万物使者进入战场时，选择一个颜色”以及“万物使者具有反该色保护异能。”由于不稳定变形兽不是作为万物使者的复制进入战场，所以它从未有为该异能选择颜色的机会，因此它不会获得保护异能。   
Example: Voice of All enters the battlefield and Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. Voice of All reads, in part, “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.” and “Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.” Unstable Shapeshifter never had a chance for a color to be chosen for it, because it didn’t enter the battlefield as Voice of All so it doesn’t gain a protection ability.

例如：维苏瓦化妖[Vesuvan Doppelganger]作为万物使者的复制进入战场，且维苏瓦化妖的操控者选择了蓝色。之后，维苏瓦化妖复制了奎利恩妖精。奎利恩妖精具有异能“{T}：加一点所选颜色的法术力。”虽然曾为维苏瓦化妖选择过颜色，但为其作出此选择的异能并未与从妖精处复制而来的法术力异能相关联。起动维苏瓦化妖的法术力异能将不会产生任何法术力。   
Example: A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Voice of All, and the Doppelganger’s controller chooses blue. Later, the Doppelganger copies Quirion Elves, which has the ability, “{T}: Add one mana of the chosen color.” Even though a color was chosen for the Doppelganger, it wasn’t chosen for the ability linked to the mana ability copied from the Elves. If that mana ability of the Doppelganger is activated, it will not produce mana.

## <span id='cr608'>608.</span> 结算咒语和异能 Resolving Spells and Abilities
<b id='cr608-1'>608.1.</b> 每次所有牌手连续让过，堆叠顶端的咒语或异能结算。（参见规则[609](./6#cr609)，“效应”。）   
<b>608.1.</b> Each time all players pass in succession, the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves. (See rule 609, “Effects.”)

<b id='cr608-2'>608.2.</b> 如果结算的物件为瞬间咒语、法术咒语或异能，其结算过程可能包含一些步骤。首先为规则[608.2a](./6#cr608-2a)和[608.2b](./6#cr608-2b)中的步骤。然后为规则[608.2c-k](./6#cr608-2c)中适合的步骤，不按照任何特定的顺序。最后为规则[608.2m](./6#cr608-2m)和[608.2n](./6#cr608-2n)中的步骤。   
<b>608.2.</b> If the object that’s resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules 608.2a and 608.2b are followed first. The steps described in rules 608.2c–k are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The steps described in rule 608.2m and 608.2n are followed last.

<b id='cr608-2a'>608.2a</b> 如果一个触发式异能包含以“若”开头的子句，它将检查该条款的条件是否符合。如果该条件不符合，该异能被移出堆叠且没有任何效果。否则，它继续结算。参见规则[603.4](./6#cr603-4)。   
<b>608.2a</b> If a triggered ability has an intervening “if” clause, it checks whether the clause’s condition is true. If it isn’t, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve. See rule 603.4.

<b id='cr608-2b'>608.2b</b> 如果该咒语或异能指定了目标，它检查这些目标是否依然合法。一个不再存在于之前宣告为目标时所在区域的目标不合法。其他对游戏状态的更改可能会导致目标不再合法；例如，其特征可能被改变或一个效应可能改变了咒语的叙述。如果异能之来源离开了其原本所在的区域，则在此过程中会使用该来源的最后已知信息。如果一个咒语或异能的每个“目标”一词对应的目标均非法，该咒语或异能不会结算；将其从堆叠上移除，且如果它是咒语，将其置入其拥有者的坟墓场。否则，它将正常结算。非法目标（如果有的话）不会受到该咒语或异能的效应中关于这些非法目标部分之影响。关于其余合法目标部分的效应仍然可能会影响这些非法目标。如果该咒语或异能创造了一个影响游戏规则的持续性效应（参见规则[613.11](./6#cr613-11)），该效应不对非法目标生效。如果该效应的一部分需要确定非法目标的信息，该效应无法确定任何信息。该效应中任何需要这些信息以生效的部分不会生效。   
<b>608.2b</b> If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target that’s no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word “target,” are now illegal, the spell or ability doesn’t resolve. It’s removed from the stack and, if it’s a spell, put into its owner’s graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, won’t be affected by parts of a resolving spell’s effect for which they’re illegal. Other parts of the effect for which those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects that affect game rules (see rule 613.11), those effects don’t apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the effect that requires that information won’t happen.

例如：索霖的饥渴是一个“索霖的饥渴对目标生物造成2点伤害，且你获得2点生命。”的黑色瞬间。如果该生物在索霖的饥渴的结算过程中不合法（例如它获得了反黑保护或离开了战场），则索霖的饥渴不会结算。其操控者不会得到生命。   
Example: Sorin’s Thirst is a black instant that reads, “Sorin’s Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and you gain 2 life.” If the creature isn’t a legal target during the resolution of Sorin’s Thirst (say, if the creature has gained protection from black or left the battlefield), then Sorin’s Thirst doesn’t resolve. Its controller doesn’t gain any life.

例如：疫病孢子为“消灭目标非黑色生物和目标地。它们不能重生。”假设同一个生物地作为非黑色生物和地被宣告为目标，且在疫病孢子结算前它的颜色被改为黑色。疫病孢子仍然会结算，因为该黑色生物地依然是该咒语“目标地”部分的合法目标。它不能重生。   
Example: Plague Spores reads, “Destroy target nonblack creature and target land. They can’t be regenerated.” Suppose the same creature land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plague Spores still resolves because the black creature land is still a legal target for the “target land” part of the spell. The “destroy target nonblack creature” part of the spell won’t affect that permanent, but the “destroy target land” part of the spell will still destroy it. It can’t be regenerated.

<b id='cr608-2c'>608.2c</b> 咒语或异能的操控者按照叙述的顺序进行动作。替代性效应可能会影响这些动作。在一些情况下，牌上之后部分的叙述可能会影响之前部分的叙述（例如，“消灭目标生物。它不能重生”或“反击目标咒语。如果该咒语被以此法反击，改为将其置于其拥有者的牌库顶而不是拥有者的坟墓场。”）在这些情况下不要不假思索便按照顺序令效应生效，需要阅读整段叙述并对其规则进行中文理解。   
<b>608.2c</b> The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text (for example, “Destroy target creature. It can’t be regenerated” or “Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its owner’s library instead of into its owner’s graveyard.”) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases—read the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text.

<b id='cr608-2d'>608.2d</b> 如果咒语或异能的一个效应令牌手作出选择，且该选择不是作为施放咒语、起动异能、或用其他方式将咒语或异能放进堆叠的一部分而已经作出的选择，则该牌手于这些效应生效时宣告其选择。牌手不能选择不合法或无法作到的选项，但从空的牌库中抓牌除外（参见规则[121.3](./1#cr121-3)）。如果一个效应令牌手分配某些事物（例如伤害或指示物）给任何数量不指定目标的牌手和/或物件，该牌手须选择数量和分配方式，使得每位被选择的牌手或物件至少获得一个所分配的事物。（注意如果一个效应令牌手分配某些事物（例如伤害或指示物）给某个数量的目标物件和/或牌手，则分配的数量和分配方式在该咒语或异能放进堆叠的时候就被确定，而非在结算时；参见规则[601.2d](./6#cr601-2d)。）   
<b>608.2d</b> If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s illegal or impossible, with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesn’t make drawing a card an impossible action (see rule 121.3). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack rather than at this time; see rule 601.2d.)

例如：一个咒语的叙述为“你可以牺牲一个生物。如果你不如此作，你失去4点生命。”一位不操控任何生物的牌手不能选择牺牲生物。   
Example: A spell’s instruction reads, “You may sacrifice a creature. If you don’t, you lose 4 life.” A player who controls no creatures can’t choose the sacrifice option.

<b id='cr608-2e'>608.2e</b> 一些咒语和异能具有影响多位牌手的多个步骤或动作，用单独的句子或条款表示。在这些情况下，按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序为第一个动作作出的选择，然后第一个动作同时进行。然后按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序为第二个动作作出选择，然后第二个动作同时进行，以此类推。参见规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)。   
<b>608.2e</b> Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 101.4.

<b id='cr608-2f'>608.2f</b> 一些咒语和异能包含对多个牌手和/或物件执行的动作。在大多数情况下，此类动作被同时处理。如果该动作不能被同时处理，则在处理时改为看作其对每个受影响的物件或牌手各自考虑。使用“主动牌手先决定”顺序作为决定这些动作执行顺序的主要依据。其次，如果该动作将同时对一位牌手和其操控的物件、或对多个由同一牌手操控的物件执行，操控正在结算的咒语或异能的牌手来选择这些动作的相对顺序。   
<b>608.2f</b> Some spells and abilities include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action can’t be processed simultaneously, it’s instead processed considering each affected player or object individually. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects controlled by the same player, the player who controls the resolving spell or ability chooses the relative order of those actions.

例如：公然剽窃叙述为“为每位对手各进行以下流程～获得目标由该牌手操控之永久物的操控权。”于公然剽窃结算时，其操控者同时获得所有被选为目标的永久物的操控权。   
Example: Blatant Thievery says “For each opponent, gain control of target permanent that player controls.” As Blatant Thievery resolves, its controller gains control of all permanents chosen as targets simultaneously.

例如：魂火爆发的部分叙述为“选择任意数量的目标生物，鹏洛客和／或牌手。为他们各进行以下流程～放逐你的牌库顶牌，然后魂火爆发对该永久物或牌手造成伤害，其数量等同于所放逐之牌的法术力值。”牌手以一位对手及一个由该牌手操控的生物为目标施放魂火爆发。于魂火爆发结算时，该牌手不能同时多次放逐其牌库顶牌，因此该牌手先选择其考虑的是哪个目标，然后其放逐其牌库顶牌，最后魂火爆发对该目标造成伤害。然后该牌手为其余的目标重复此流程。   
Example: Soulfire Eruption says, in part, “Choose any number of target creatures, planeswalkers, and/or players. For each of them, exile the top card of your library, then Soulfire Eruption deals damage equal to that card’s mana value to that permanent or player.” A player casts Soulfire Eruption targeting an opponent and a creature that opponent controls. As Soulfire Eruption resolves, the player can’t exile the top card of their library multiple times at the same time, so they first choose which target they are considering, then they exile the top card of their library, and finally Soulfire Eruption deals damage to that target. They then repeat this process for the remaining target.

<b id='cr608-2g'>608.2g</b> 如果一个效应给予牌手支付法术力的选择，他在进行该动作之前可以起动法术力异能。如果一个效应明确指示或允许牌手在结算过程中施放一个咒语，他将该咒语放在堆叠顶端，然后继续按照规则[601.2a-h](./6#cr601-2a)中的步骤施放该咒语，但没有牌手在它被施放之后得到优先权。该咒语成为堆叠最顶端的物件，然后当前正在结算的咒语或异能继续结算，它可能包括以此法施放另一个咒语。一般情况下，在结算过程中没有其他咒语可以被施放且没有其他异能可以被起动。   
<b>608.2g</b> If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do so by following the steps in rules 601.2a–i, except no player receives priority after it’s cast. That spell becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve, which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution.

<b id='cr608-2h'>608.2h</b> 如果一个效应需要游戏信息（例如战场上生物的数量），答案只在该效应生效时决定一次。如果该效应需要一个特定物件的信息，包括该异能自身的来源，如果该物件依然在它应在的公开区域，则该效应使用其当前信息；如果该物件已经不在该区域或该效应将该物件从公开区域移动到隐藏区域，则该效应使用其最后已知信息。参见规则[113.7a](./1#cr113-7a)。如果一个异能的叙述为该物件作出动作，则是该存在的或最后存在的物件进行该动作，而不是异能本身。   
<b>608.2h</b> If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that object if it’s in the public zone it was expected to be in; if it’s no longer in that zone, or if the effect has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the object’s last known information. See rule 113.7a. If an ability states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists—or as it most recently existed—that does it, not the ability.

<b id='cr608-2i'>608.2i</b> 如果一个效应引用一个特定的特征，它只检查该特定的特征之数值，无视该物件可能具有的有关联的特征。   
<b>608.2i</b> If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have.

例如：一个“消灭所有黑色生物”的效应将消灭一个黑色及白色的生物，但“消灭所有非黑生物”不会。   
Example: An effect that reads “Destroy all black creatures” destroys a white-and-black creature, but one that reads “Destroy all nonblack creatures” doesn’t.

<b id='cr608-2j'>608.2j</b> 如果一个异能的效应引用一个特定的物件，且该物件之前被该异能的费用或触发条件引用过，则它依然会影响该物件，即使它的特征已经改变。   
<b>608.2j</b> If an ability’s effect refers to a specific untargeted object that has been previously referred to by that ability’s cost or trigger condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed characteristics.

例如：泪之墙具有“每当泪之墙阻挡一个生物，在战斗结束时将该生物移回其拥有者的手上。”如果泪之墙阻挡一个生物，然后该生物在触发式异能结算之前不再是生物，该永久物依然会被移回其拥有者手上。   
Example: Wall of Tears says “Whenever Wall of Tears blocks a creature, return that creature to its owner’s hand at end of combat.” If Wall of Tears blocks a creature, then that creature ceases to be a creature before the triggered ability resolves, the permanent will still be returned to its owner’s hand.

<b id='cr608-2k'>608.2k</b> 如果一个瞬间咒语、法术咒语、或异能可以合法结算，即使它在开始结算后离开堆叠，它也会继续完整结算。   
<b>608.2k</b> If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally resolve leaves the stack once it starts to resolve, it will continue to resolve fully.

<b id='cr608-2m'>608.2m</b> 作为瞬间或法术咒语结算的最后部分，该咒语被放进其拥有者的坟墓场。作为异能结算的最后部分，该异能被从堆叠移除并消失。   
<b>608.2m</b> As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell’s resolution, the spell is put into its owner’s graveyard. As the final part of an ability’s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.

<b id='cr608-2n'>608.2n</b> 一旦完成608.2c-m中所述之所有可能的步骤，任何在该咒语或异能结算时触发的异能触发。   
<b>608.2n</b> Once all possible steps described in 608.2c–m are completed, any abilities that trigger when that spell or ability resolves trigger.

<b id='cr608-3'>608.3.</b> 如果正在结算的物件是永久物咒语，其结算可能包含数个步骤。规则[608.3a](./6#cr608-3a)和b所述的指示总是首先执行。然后，规则[608.3c-e](./6#cr608-3c)其中之一的步骤如适用，则执行之。   
<b>608.3.</b> If the object that’s resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution may involve several steps. The instructions in rules 608.3a and b are always performed first. Then one of the steps in rule 608.3c–e is performed, if appropriate.

<b id='cr608-3a'>608.3a</b> 如果正在结算的物件没有目标，则它成为永久物并在该咒语操控者的操控下被放进战场。   
<b>608.3a</b> If the object that’s resolving has no targets, it becomes a permanent and enters the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller.

<b id='cr608-3b'>608.3b</b> 如果正在结算的物件具有目标，则它依照规则[608.2b](./6#cr608-2b)的叙述，检查其目标是否依然合法。如果一个神授式灵气咒语（参见规则[702.103e](./7#cr702-103e)）或合变式生物咒语（参见规则[702.140b](./7#cr702-140b)）的目标不合法，该咒语成为生物咒语，并依照规则[608.3a](./6#cr608-3a)的叙述结算。否则，该咒语不会结算。它被移出堆叠并置入其拥有者的坟墓场。   
<b>608.3b</b> If the object that’s resolving has a target, it checks whether the target is still legal, as described in 608.2b. If a spell with an illegal target is a bestowed Aura spell (see rule 702.103e) or a mutating creature spell (see rule 702.140b), it becomes a creature spell and will resolve as described in rule 608.3a. Otherwise, the spell doesn’t resolve. It is removed from the stack and put into its owner’s graveyard.

<b id='cr608-3c'>608.3c</b> 如果正在结算的物件是灵气咒语，则该咒语成为永久物，在其操控者的操控下被放进战场，并贴附于其目标所指的物件上。   
<b>608.3c</b> If the object that’s resolving is an Aura spell, it becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller attached to the player or object it was targeting.

<b id='cr608-3d'>608.3d</b> 如果正在结算的物件是合变式生物咒语，则代表该咒语的物件与其目标所指的永久物结聚（参见规则[727](./7#cr727)，“与永久物结聚”。）   
<b>608.3d</b> If the object that’s resolving is a mutating creature spell, the object representing that spell merges with the permanent it is targeting (see rule 727, “Merging with Permanents”).

<b id='cr608-3e'>608.3e</b> 如果一个永久物咒语结算，但其操控者不能将其放进战场，则该牌手将其放进其拥有者的坟墓场。   
<b>608.3e</b> If a permanent spell resolves but its controller can’t put it onto the battlefield, that player puts it into its owner’s graveyard.

例如：遍地蠕虫[Worms of the Earth]具有“地不能进入战场。”仿生妖具有“你可以令仿生妖作为战场上另一个生物的复制进入战场。”如果牌手在战场上有遍地蠕虫的情况下，施放仿生妖并选择复制树灵乔木（一个地生物），仿生妖不能从堆叠中进入战场。它被放进其拥有者的坟墓场。   
Example: Worms of the Earth has the ability “Lands can’t enter the battlefield.” Clone says “You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.” If a player casts Clone and chooses to copy Dryad Arbor (a land creature) while Worms of the Earth is on the battlefield, Clone can’t enter the battlefield from the stack. It’s put into its owner’s graveyard.

<b id='cr608-3f'>608.3f</b> 如果正在结算的物件是永久物咒语的复制品，于该物件经由以上任一步骤中被放进战场时，其成为衍生永久物。以此法放进战场的衍生物不再是咒语的复制品，在提及派出衍生物的规则或效应的意义上也并未被“派出”。   
<b>608.3f</b> If the object that’s resolving is a copy of a permanent spell, it will become a token permanent as it is put onto the battlefield in any of the steps above. A token put onto the battlefield this way is no longer a copy of a spell and is not “created” for the purposes of any rules or effects that refer to creating a token.

<b id='cr608-3g'>608.3g</b> 如果正在结算的物件具有在堆叠上运作、并创造一个延迟触发式异能的静止式异能，该延迟触发式异能于该永久物经由以上任一步骤中被放进战场时创造。（参见规则[702.109](./7#cr702-109)，“掩袭”，和规则[702.152](./7#cr702-152)，“急袭”。）   
<b>608.3g</b> If the object that’s resolving has a static ability that functions on the stack and creates a delayed triggered ability, that delayed triggered ability is created as that permanent is put onto the battlefield in any of the steps above. (See rules 702.109, “Dash,” and rule 702.152, “Blitz.”)

## <span id='cr609'>609.</span> 效应 Effects
<b id='cr609-1'>609.1.</b> 效应为咒语或异能在游戏中所产生的结果。当一个咒语、起动式异能、或触发式异能结算时，它可能会创造一个或数个一次性效应或持续性效应。静止式异能可能创造一个或数个持续性效应。叙述本身不是效应。   
<b>609.1.</b> An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or ability. When a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.

<b id='cr609-2'>609.2.</b> 效应只对永久物生效，除非叙述特别指明或它们明显只对其他区域中的物件生效。   
<b>609.2.</b> Effects apply only to permanents unless the instruction’s text states otherwise or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more other zones.

例如：一个将所有地变为生物的效应不会改变牌手坟墓场中的地牌。但一个令咒语多支付费用来施放的效应将只对堆叠中的咒语生效，因为牌手施放咒语时该咒语一定是在堆叠上。   
Example: An effect that changes all lands into creatures won’t alter land cards in players’ graveyards. But an effect that says spells cost more to cast will apply only to spells on the stack, since a spell is always on the stack while a player is casting it.

<b id='cr609-3'>609.3.</b> 如果一个效应尝试作无法作到的事，它从中作尽可能多的部分。   
<b>609.3.</b> If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible.

例如：如果某牌手手上只有一张牌，一个“弃两张牌”的效应将导致他只弃掉该牌。如果一个效应从牌库中移走牌（而不是抓牌），它只从中移走尽可能多的牌。   
Example: If a player is holding only one card, an effect that reads “Discard two cards” causes them to discard only that card. If an effect moves cards out of the library (as opposed to drawing), it moves as many as possible.

<b id='cr609-4'>609.4.</b> 一些效应令牌手将某些条件“视同”正确的情况下作一些事，或令生物将某些条件“视同”正确的情况下作一些事。这只对该被指出的效应生效。对于该效应来说，将游戏当作该条件为正确来对待。对于其他情况，将游戏按照一般情况对待。   
<b>609.4.</b> Some effects state that a player may do something “as though” some condition were true or a creature can do something “as though” some condition were true. This applies only to the stated effect. For purposes of that effect, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition were true. For all other purposes, treat the game normally.

<b id='cr609-4a'>609.4a</b> 如果两个效应令牌手可以（或生物可以）将两个不同的条件“视同”正确的情况下作一些事，这两个条件可能都会生效。如果其中一个被“视同”的效应符合另一个被“视同”的效应，则两者均生效。   
<b>609.4a</b> If two effects state that a player may (or a creature can) do the same thing “as though” different conditions were true, both conditions could apply. If one “as though” effect satisfies the requirements for another “as though” effect, then both effects will apply.

例如：某牌手操控维多肯星像仪，一个具有“你可以将咒语视同具有闪现异能地来施放。”的神器。该牌手施放巫医交神，一个部分叙述为“本回合中，你可以视同在你的坟墓场中一般，从其他牌手的坟墓场中使用地及施放咒语。”的瞬间。该牌手可以视同在自己的坟墓场中一般，并视同其具有闪现一般，从其他牌手的坟墓场中施放具有返照的法术。   
Example: A player controls Vedalken Orrery, an artifact that says “You may cast spells as though they had flash.” That player casts Shaman’s Trance, an instant that says, in part, “You may play lands and cast spells from other players’ graveyards this turn as though those cards were in your graveyard.” The player may cast a sorcery with flashback from another player’s graveyard as though it were in that player’s graveyard and as though it had flash.

<b id='cr609-4b'>609.4b</b> 如果一个效应允许牌手“视同任意[种类或颜色]的法术力”来支付法术力，这仅影响该牌手可以如何支付费用。这并不会改变该费用，也不会改变实际支付该费用时使用的法术力之种类或颜色。具有“能用任意种类的法术力”的效应亦是如此。   
<b>609.4b</b> If an effect allows a player to spend mana “as though it were mana of any [type or color],” this affects only how the player may pay a cost. It doesn’t change that cost, and it doesn’t change what mana was actually spent to pay that cost. The same is true for effects that say “mana of any type can be spent.”

<b id='cr609-5'>609.5.</b> 如果一个效应可能会以不分先后作为结果，则创造该效应的咒语或异能之叙述会指出在此情况下如何。万智牌游戏本身对不分先后没有默认结果。   
<b>609.5.</b> If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The Magic game has no default for ties.

<b id='cr609-6'>609.6.</b> 一些持续性效应为替代性效应或防止性效应。参见规则[614](./6#cr614)和[615](./6#cr615)。   
<b>609.6.</b> Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rules 614 and 615.

<b id='cr609-7'>609.7.</b> 一些效应从来源对伤害生效；例如，“于本回合中，防止由你选择的红色来源下一次将对你所造成的伤害。”   
<b>609.7.</b> Some effects apply to damage from a source—for example, “The next time a red source of your choice would deal damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.”

<b id='cr609-7a'>609.7a</b> 如果一个效应要求牌手选择一个伤害来源，他可以选择一个永久物；一个堆叠中的咒语（包括永久物咒语）；一个堆叠中的物件、一个等待生效的替代性或防止性效应、或一个等待触发的延迟触发式异能（即使该物件已经不再在其之前所在的区域），所提及的任何物件；或者一个统帅区中面朝上的物件。一个来源不需要可以造成伤害才能被合法选择。当该效应被创造时选择该来源。如果该牌手选择了一个永久物，该效应将对该永久物下一次将造成的伤害生效，无论是战斗伤害还是由咒语或异能令其造成的伤害。如果该牌手选择了一个永久物咒语，该效应将对该咒语以及当该咒语结算时成为的永久物生效。   
<b>609.7a</b> If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a replacement or prevention effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that’s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. The source is chosen when the effect is created. If the player chooses a permanent, the effect will apply to the next damage dealt by that permanent, regardless of whether it’s combat damage or damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability. If the player chooses a permanent spell, the effect will apply to any damage dealt by that spell and any damage dealt by the permanent that spell becomes when it resolves.

<b id='cr609-7b'>609.7b</b> 一些已经结算的咒语或异能所产生的效应防止或替代来自某种特定属性来源的伤害，例如生物或某颜色为来源。当该来源将造成伤害时，该“护盾”再次检查该来源的属性。如果不再符合该属性，该伤害不会被防止或替代。如果该护盾因为任何原因没有防止或替代任何伤害，则该护盾没有被使用。   
<b>609.7b</b> Some effects from resolved spells and abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties, such as a creature or a source of a particular color. When the source would deal damage, the “shield” rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced. If for any reason the shield prevents no damage or replaces no damage, the shield isn’t used up.

<b id='cr609-7c'>609.7c</b> 一些静止式异能所产生的效应防止或替代来自某种特定属性来源的伤害。这些效应对具有该属性的永久物来源和具有该属性且不在战场的来源生效。   
<b>609.7c</b> Some effects from static abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties. For these effects, the prevention or replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and to any sources that aren’t on the battlefield that have that property.

<b id='cr609-8'>609.8.</b> 一些效应需要回溯，考虑先前的游戏状态，而非当前的游戏状态。如果此类效应提及一个或一组物件，只要这些物件在该时间存在于该动作执行时所在的区域、或符合该动作所述的条件，它们便无需当前仍存在于该区域、或当前仍符合该条件。   
<b>609.8.</b> Some effects look back in time and consider previous game states and actions rather than considering the current game state. If such an effect refers to an object or group of objects, those objects don’t need to be currently in the zone they were in at the time of the action, nor do they need to currently meet the criteria described in the action, as long as they did so at the specified time.

例如：牌手使用幼熊[Bear Cub]攻击。在该回合稍后的时间中，一个效应使得幼熊成为非生物的永久物。然后，同一位牌手施放搜救队长，其部分叙述为“本回合中你每以一个生物攻击过，此咒语便减少{1}来施放。”因为该牌手用一个生物攻击过，该咒语减少{1}来施放，即使攻击过的幼熊已经不再是生物也是一样。   
Example: A player attacks with Bear Cub. Later in the turn, an effect causes Bear Cub to become a noncreature permanent. The same player then casts Search Party Captain, a spell that says in part “This spell costs {1} less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn.” That spell costs {1} less because the player attacked with a creature, even though the Bear Cub they attacked with is no longer a creature.

## <span id='cr610'>610.</span> 一次性效应 One-Shot Effects
<b id='cr610-1'>610.1.</b> 一次性效应只作一次事且不具有时限。例如造成伤害、消灭永久物、派出一个衍生物、以及将一个物件从一个区域移到另一个。   
<b>610.1.</b> A one-shot effect does something just once and doesn’t have a duration. Examples include dealing damage, destroying a permanent, creating a token, and moving an object from one zone to another.

<b id='cr610-2'>610.2.</b> 一些一次性效应创造延迟触发式异能，它令该牌手在之后的游戏中作某事（一般在特定的时间），而不是于创造该一次性效应的咒语或异能结算时。参见规则[603.7](./6#cr603-7)。   
<b>610.2.</b> Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered ability, which instructs a player to do something later in the game (usually at a specific time) rather than as the spell or ability that’s creating the one-shot effect resolves. See rule 603.7.

<b id='cr610-3'>610.3.</b> 一些一次性效应使得一个物件改变区域“直到”某个特定事件发生。在该事件发生后，另一个一次性效应立即被创造。后者效应将该物件移回原来的区域。   
<b>610.3.</b> Some one-shot effects cause an object to change zones “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect returns the object to its previous zone.

<b id='cr610-3a'>610.3a</b> 如果正在结算的咒语或起动式异能创造了上述前者导致物件改变区域的一次性效应，且该特定事件在该咒语或异能放进堆叠之后、但在一次性效应将要发生之前已经发生，则该物件不会改变区域。   
<b>610.3a</b> If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the object doesn’t move.

<b id='cr610-3b'>610.3b</b> 如果正在结算的触发式异能创造了上述前者导致物件改变区域的一次性效应，且该特定事件在该异能触发之后、但在一次性效应将要发生之前已经发生，则该物件不会改变区域。   
<b>610.3b</b> If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the object doesn’t move.

<b id='cr610-3c'>610.3c</b> 除非另有说明，以此法移回战场的物件在其拥有者的操控下返回战场。   
<b>610.3c</b> An object returned to the battlefield this way returns under its owner’s control unless otherwise specified.

<b id='cr610-3d'>610.3d</b> 如果多个一次性效应在一个或数个同时发生的事件之后立即被创造，这些一次性效应亦是同时发生的。   
<b>610.3d</b> If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events, those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.

例如：两个逐令僧侣各放逐了一张牌。审判末日同时消灭了所有生物。两张被放逐的牌同时返回战场。   
Example: Two Banisher Priests have each exiled a card. All creatures are destroyed at the same time by Day of Judgment. The two exiled cards are returned to the battlefield at the same time.

<b id='cr610-4'>610.4.</b> 一些一次性效应使得一个永久物跃离“直到”某个特定事件发生。在该事件发生后，另一个一次性效应立即被创造。后者效应使得该永久物跃回。   
<b>610.4.</b> Some one-shot effects cause a permanent to phase out “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect causes the permanent to phase in.

<b id='cr610-4a'>610.4a</b> 以此法跃离的永久物不因牌手重置步骤（参见规则[502.1](./5#cr502-1)）中的回合动作之故而跃回。其他效应仍然可能使得其跃回。如果以此法跃离的永久物因另一个效应之故而跃回，上述后者一次性动作不会发生，即使该永久物再次跃离。   
<b>610.4a</b> A permanent phased out this way doesn’t phase in as a result of the turn-based action during a player’s untap step (see rule 502.1). Other effects may cause it to phase in. If a permanent phased out this way phases in due to another effect, the second one-shot effect doesn’t happen, even if that permanent has phased out again.

<b id='cr610-4b'>610.4b</b> 如果正在结算的咒语或起动式异能创造了上述前者导致物件跃离的一次性效应，且该特定事件在该咒语或异能放进堆叠之后、但在一次性效应将要发生之前已经发生，则该物件不会跃离。   
<b>610.4b</b> If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the permanent doesn’t phase out.

<b id='cr610-4c'>610.4c</b> 如果正在结算的触发式异能创造了上述前者导致物件跃离的一次性效应，且该特定事件在该异能触发之后、但在一次性效应将要发生之前已经发生，则该物件不会跃离。   
<b>610.4c</b> If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the permanent doesn’t phase out.

<b id='cr610-4d'>610.4d</b> 如果多个一次性效应在一个或数个同时发生的事件之后立即被创造，这些一次性效应亦是同时发生的。   
<b>610.4d</b> If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events, those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.

## <span id='cr611'>611.</span> 持续性效应 Continuous Effects
<b id='cr611-1'>611.1.</b> 一个持续性效应在指定时限中或无限期地，影响物件的特征、影响物件的操控权、或影响牌手或游戏的规则。   
<b>611.1.</b> A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects, modifies control of objects, or affects players or the rules of the game, for a fixed or indefinite period.

<b id='cr611-2'>611.2.</b> 一个持续性效应可能由于一个咒语或异能的结算而产生。   
<b>611.2.</b> A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability.

<b id='cr611-2a'>611.2a</b> 一个由咒语或异能的结算所产生的持续性效应，在产生它的咒语或异能所列出的时间段内生效（例如“直到回合结束”）。如果没有列出时间段，则它生效直到游戏结束。   
<b>611.2a</b> A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability lasts as long as stated by the spell or ability creating it (such as “until end of turn”). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game.

<b id='cr611-2b'>611.2b</b> 一些由咒语或异能的结算所产生的持续性效应具有使用“只要……”的时间段。如果“只要……”的时间段从未开始过，或在它最先生效的一刻之前便已经结束，该效应没有任何效果。它不会开始并马上结束，也不会永远生效。   
<b>611.2b</b> Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability have durations worded “for as long as . . . .” If the “for as long as” duration never starts, or it ends before the moment the effect would first be applied, the effect does nothing. It doesn’t start and immediately stop again, and it doesn’t last forever.

例如：神偷具有异能“当神偷进战场时，只要你操控神偷，你便获得目标神器的操控权。”若你在该异能结算前你不再操控神偷，该异能将没有任何效果，因为其时间段（只要你操控神偷）在效应开始前便已经结束。   
Example: Master Thief has the ability “When Master Thief enters the battlefield, gain control of target artifact for as long as you control Master Thief.” If you lose control of Master Thief before the ability resolves, it does nothing, because its duration—as long as you control Master Thief—was over before the effect began.

<b id='cr611-2c'>611.2c</b> 如果一个由咒语或异能的结算所产生的持续性效应影响特征或改变任何物件的操控权，这组受其影响的物件在该持续性效应开始时决定。在此之后，该组永久物不会改变。（注意这与一个静止式异能所产生的持续性效应不同。）一个由咒语或异能的结算所产生且不影响特征或改变任何物件操控权的持续性效应影响游戏规则，所以它们可以影响在该持续性效应开始时并不受其影响的物件。如果一个单独的持续性效应中的一部分影响物件的特征或改变物件的操控权，而其他部分不如此作，则受各部分影响的物件各自单独决定。   
<b>611.2c</b> If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous effect begins. After that point, the set won’t change. (Note that this works differently than a continuous effect from a static ability.) A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability that doesn’t modify the characteristics or change the controller of any objects modifies the rules of the game, so it can affect objects that weren’t affected when that continuous effect began. If a single continuous effect has parts that modify the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects and other parts that don’t, the set of objects each part applies to is determined independently.

例如：一个效应为“所有白色生物得+1/+1直到回合结束”，它将在该咒语或异能结算时给所有为白色生物的永久物+1/+1（即使它们的颜色之后改变），且不会影响之后进入战场或成为白色的生物。   
Example: An effect that reads “All white creatures get +1/+1 until end of turn” gives the bonus to all permanents that are white creatures when the spell or ability resolves—even if they change color later—and doesn’t affect those that enter the battlefield or turn white afterward.

例如：一个效应为“防止本回合中生物将造成的所有伤害”，它不影响任何特征，所以它影响游戏规则。这表示该效应将对在该效应开始时不在战场的生物同样生效。它也会影响本回合中之后成为生物的永久物。   
Example: An effect that reads “Prevent all damage creatures would deal this turn” doesn’t modify any object’s characteristics, so it’s modifying the rules of the game. That means the effect will apply even to damage from creatures that weren’t on the battlefield when the continuous effect began. It also affects damage from permanents that become creatures later in the turn.

<b id='cr611-2d'>611.2d</b> 如果一个结算中的咒语或异能将产生一个包含可变数值的持续性效应，例如X，该可变数值的数值只在结算时决定一次。参见规则[608.2h](./6#cr608-2h)。   
<b>611.2d</b> If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect contains a variable such as X, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule 608.2h.

<b id='cr611-2e'>611.2e</b> 如果一个结算中的咒语或异能既将一个非衍生物的永久物放进战场，又创造一个持续性效应叙述该永久物“是[特征]”或“具有[特征]”，该持续性效应于该永久物进战场的同时立即生效。这个特征通常是颜色或生物类别。如果持续性效应叙述该永久物“成为[特征]”或“获得[异能]”，该效应在永久物进战场之后生效。   
<b>611.2e</b> If a resolving spell or ability both puts a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield and creates a continuous effect stating that the permanent “is [characteristic],” that continuous effect applies simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. This characteristic is usually a color or a creature type. If the continuous effect says the permanent “becomes [characteristic]” or “gains [an ability],” that effect applies after the permanent is on the battlefield.

例如：理念仲裁者将一个神器、生物或地牌放进战场，其异能的部分叙述为“该永久物额外具有“结界”此类别。”因结界进战场而触发的异能会因此触发。以此法进战场的永久物并非进入战场然后才成为结界。   
Example: Arbiter of the Ideal puts an artifact, creature, or land card onto the battlefield and says, in part, “That permanent is an enchantment in addition to its other types.” An ability that triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield would trigger. The permanent doesn’t enter the battlefield and then become an enchantment.

<b id='cr611-2f'>611.2f</b> 一些咒语和异能产生一个持续性效应，其修改一位牌手下一个施放的咒语的特征，或修改一位牌手于某时段内施放且满足特定条件的咒语的特征，或有类似的效果。这些效应不会立即生效。相反，它们会在该牌手下一次将合适的咒语放进堆叠时开始对该咒语生效，并应用于该咒语。参见规则[601.2a](./6#cr601-2a)。   
<b>611.2f</b> Some spells and abilities generate a continuous effect that modifies the characteristics of the next spell a player casts, the next spell that fulfills certain conditions a player casts during some duration, or similar. These effects do not begin immediately. Rather, they begin to apply at the time that player next puts an appropriate spell on the stack, and they apply to that spell. See rule 601.2a.

<b id='cr611-3'>611.3.</b> 持续性效应可能由物件的静止式异能产生。   
<b>611.3.</b> A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an object.

<b id='cr611-3a'>611.3a</b> 由静止式异能所产生的持续性效应没有被“锁定”；它在任何时刻均对其叙述包含的内容生效。   
<b>611.3a</b> A continuous effect generated by a static ability isn’t “locked in”; it applies at any given moment to whatever its text indicates.

<b id='cr611-3b'>611.3b</b> 一个效应在产生它的永久物在战场期间或产生它的物件在对应的区域期间均生效。   
<b>611.3b</b> The effect applies at all times that the permanent generating it is on the battlefield or the object generating it is in the appropriate zone.

例如：一个具有静止式异能“所有白色生物得+1/+1”的永久物产生的效应持续给予每个战场上的白色生物+1/+1。如果一个生物成为白色，它得到+1/+1；一个不再是白色的生物失去它。   
Example: A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get +1/+1” generates an effect that continuously gives +1/+1 to each white creature on the battlefield. If a creature becomes white, it gets this bonus; a creature that stops being white loses it.

<b id='cr611-3c'>611.3c</b> 影响永久物特征的持续性效应于该永久物进入战场的同时生效。它们不等到永久物在战场后再改变它。由于这些效应于永久物进入战场时生效，它们在决定该永久物是否在进入战场时触发异能之前生效。   
<b>611.3c</b> Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. They don’t wait until the permanent is on the battlefield and then change it. Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they are applied before determining whether the permanent will cause an ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield.

例如：一个具有静止式异能“所有白色生物得+1/+1”的永久物在战场上。一般情况下创造1/1白色生物的生物咒语将改为创造2/2白色生物。该生物不会作为1/1生物进入战场然后成为2/2。   
Example: A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get +1/+1” is on the battlefield. A creature spell that would normally create a 1/1 white creature instead creates a 2/2 white creature. The creature doesn’t enter the battlefield as 1/1 and then change to 2/2.

<b id='cr611-3d'>611.3d</b> 静止式异能的持续性效应可能允许牌手使用地，施放永久物咒语，或是赋予永久物咒语或永久物牌一个允许其被施放的异能。如果此效应同时还赋予该物件一个仅在战场上生效的异能，则此异能在赋予该许可或异能的效应列出的时间段内生效。如果没有列出时间段，则它生效直到游戏结束。这是规则[611.3a-b](./6#cr611-3a)的例外情况。   
<b>611.3d</b> Continuous effects from static abilities may allow a player to play a land or cast a permanent spell, or may grant an ability to a permanent spell or card that allows it to be cast. If the effect also grants that object an ability that functions only on the battlefield, that ability lasts as long as stated by the effect granting that permission or ability. If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game. This is an exception to rules 611.3a–b.

## <span id='cr612'>612.</span> 改变叙述的效应 Text-Changing Effects
<b id='cr612-1'>612.1.</b> 一些持续性效应改变物件的叙述。这对任何词语或该物件印有的符号生效，但一般情况下只影响该物件的规则叙述（在其文字栏中）和/或其类别栏中的叙述。此类效应为改变叙述的效应。   
<b>612.1.</b> Some continuous effects change an object’s text. This can apply to any words or symbols printed on that object, but generally affects only that object’s rules text (which appears in its text box) and/or the text that appears in its type line. Such an effect is a text-changing effect.

<b id='cr612-2'>612.2.</b> 改变叙述的效应只改变正确使用的词语（例如，作为颜色使用的万智牌颜色词、作为地类别使用的地类别词、或作为生物类别使用的生物类别词）。一个改变颜色词或副类别的效应不会改变牌的名称，即使该名称包含与万智牌颜色词、基本地类别、或生物类别相同的词语。   
<b>612.2.</b> A text-changing effect changes only those words that are used in the correct way (for example, a Magic color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a creature type). An effect that changes a color word or a subtype can’t change a card name, even if that name contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a Magic color word, basic land type, or creature type.

<b id='cr612-2a'>612.2a</b> 大多数派出衍生生物的咒语或异能使用生物类别定义该衍生物的生物类别和名称。一个影响此类咒语或具有此类异能物件的改变叙述的效应可以改变这些词语，因为它们被用作生物类别，即使它们也被用作名称。   
<b>612.2a</b> Most spells and abilities that create creature tokens use creature types to define both the creature types and the names of the tokens. A text-changing effect that affects such a spell or an object with such an ability can change these words because they’re being used as creature types, even though they’re also being used as names.

<b id='cr612-3'>612.3.</b> 添加或移除异能的效应不会改变受其影响物件的叙述，所以任何被给予该物件的异能不受影响该物件的改变叙述的效应所影响。   
<b>612.3.</b> Effects that add or remove abilities don’t change the text of the objects they affect, so any abilities that are granted to an object can’t be modified by text-changing effects that affect that object.

<b id='cr612-4'>612.4.</b> 一个衍生物的副类别以及规则叙述由派出它的咒语或异能定义。一个影响衍生物的改变叙述的效应可以改变这些特征。   
<b>612.4.</b> A token’s subtypes and rules text are defined by the spell or ability that created the token. A text-changing effect that affects a token can change these characteristics.

<b id='cr612-5'>612.5.</b> 一张牌（Exchange of Words）指示牌手交换两个物件的文字栏。这会将每个物件的规则叙述全部替换为另一者的规则叙述。（在涉及本规则未涵盖的某些牌的游戏中，文字栏的其他元素也可能被交换。参见规则[100.7](./1#cr100-7)。）   
<b>612.5.</b> One card (Exchange of Words) instructs a player to exchange the text boxes of two objects. This replaces all of the rules text of each object with the rules text of the other object. (In games involving certain cards that aren’t covered by these rules, other elements of the text box may also be exchanged. See rule 100.7.)

<b id='cr612-6'>612.6.</b> 一张牌（瓦拉司的变形兽）令一个物件具有另一个物件的“全部叙述”。这不仅仅改变该物件文字栏和类别栏中的叙述，同样改变表示其名称、法术力费用、力量以及防御力的叙述。   
<b>612.6.</b> One card (Volrath’s Shapeshifter) states that an object has the “full text” of another object. This changes not just the text that appears in the object’s text box and type line, but also changes the text that represents its name, mana cost, color indicator, power, and toughness.

<b id='cr612-7'>612.7.</b> 一张牌（谍报用具）令一个物件具有“所有非传奇生物牌之名称”。这会改变代表该物件之名称的叙述。该物件具有Oracle牌张参考文献中的每张非传奇生物牌之名称。（参见规则[108.1](./1#cr108-1)。）   
<b>612.7.</b> One card (Spy Kit) states that an object has “all names of nonlegendary creature cards.” This changes the text that represents the object’s name. That object has the name of each nonlegendary creature card in the Oracle card reference. (See rule 108.1.)

<b id='cr612-8'>612.8.</b> 一些牌创造一个持续性效应，设定一个物件的名称。这会改变代表该物件之名称的叙述。该物件失去原有的名称，并仅具有所指定的名称。   
<b>612.8.</b> Some cards create a continuous effect that sets the name of an object. This changes the text that represents the object’s name. That object loses any names it had and has only the specified name.

<b id='cr612-9'>612.9.</b> 在永久物上、或在一张不在战场上的牌上的名称贴纸创造一个持续性效应，会将单词加入代表该物件之名称的叙述中。（参见规则[123.6](./1#cr123-6)。）   
<b>612.9.</b> A name sticker on a permanent or on a card not on the battlefield creates a continuous effect that adds a word to the text that represents the object’s name. (See rule 123.6.)

<b id='cr612-10'>612.10.</b> 通联异能改变咒语的叙述，其方式是将具通联异能的牌上的规则叙述加到另一个咒语的规则叙述中，其位置在该咒语本身的规则叙述之后。通联不会改变或替代该咒语本身的任何叙述。（参见规则[702.47](./7#cr702-47)，“通联”。）   
<b>612.10.</b> A splice ability changes a spell’s text by adding the rules text of the card with splice to the spell, following that spell’s own rules text. It doesn’t modify or replace any of that spell’s own text. (See rule 702.47, “Splice.”)

## <span id='cr613'>613.</span> 持续性效应的互动 Interaction of Continuous Effects
<b id='cr613-1'>613.1.</b> 确定物件特征首先从该物件本身开始。对于一张牌来说，这表示牌上所印的特征。对于衍生物或咒语与牌的复制来说，这表示创造它的效应对其定义的特征。然后所有适用的持续性效应以一系列分层的形式按照以下顺序生效：   
<b>613.1.</b> The values of an object’s characteristics are determined by starting with the actual object. For a card, that means the values of the characteristics printed on that card. For a token or a copy of a spell or card, that means the values of the characteristics defined by the effect that created it. Then all applicable continuous effects are applied in a series of layers in the following order:

<b id='cr613-1a'>613.1a</b> 层1：影响可复制特征值的规则和效应生效。   
<b>613.1a</b> Layer 1: Rules and effects that modify copiable values are applied.

<b id='cr613-1b'>613.1b</b> 层2：改变操控权的效应生效。   
<b>613.1b</b> Layer 2: Control-changing effects are applied.

<b id='cr613-1c'>613.1c</b> 层3：改变叙述的效应生效。参见规则[612](./6#cr612)，“改变叙述的效应”。   
<b>613.1c</b> Layer 3: Text-changing effects are applied. See rule 612, “Text-Changing Effects.”

<b id='cr613-1d'>613.1d</b> 层4：改变类别的效应生效。这包括改变物件的牌类别、副类别、和/或超类别。   
<b>613.1d</b> Layer 4: Type-changing effects are applied. These include effects that change an object’s card type, subtype, and/or supertype.

<b id='cr613-1e'>613.1e</b> 层5：改变颜色的效应生效。   
<b>613.1e</b> Layer 5: Color-changing effects are applied.

<b id='cr613-1f'>613.1f</b> 层6：添加异能的效应、关键字指示物、移除异能的效应以及令物件不能具有某异能的效应生效。   
<b>613.1f</b> Layer 6: Ability-adding effects, keyword counters, ability-removing effects, and effects that say an object can’t have an ability are applied.

<b id='cr613-1g'>613.1g</b> 层7：改变力量和/或防御力的效应生效。   
<b>613.1g</b> Layer 7: Power- and/or toughness-changing effects are applied.

<b id='cr613-2'>613.2.</b> 在层1中，效应以一系列副分层的形式按照以下顺序生效。在每个副分层中，效应按照时间印记顺序生效。（参见规则[613.7](./6#cr613-7)。）注意，从属关系可能会改变同一副分层中效应生效的顺序。（参见规则[613.8](./6#cr613-8)。）   
<b>613.2.</b> Within layer 1, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)

<b id='cr613-2a'>613.2a</b> 层1a：可复制效应生效。这包括复制效应（参见规则[707](./7#cr707)，“复制物件”）以及由一个物件与一个永久物结聚而确定的对物件基础特征的改变（参见规则[727](./7#cr727)，“与永久物结聚”）。如果“于...进战场时”以及“于...翻回正面时”异能设定力量和防御力，则其产生可复制效应，即使其同时设定其他特征。   
<b>613.2a</b> Layer 1a: Copiable effects are applied. This includes copy effects (see rule 707, “Copying Objects”) and changes to an object’s characteristics determined by merging an object with a permanent (see rule 727, “Merging with Permanents”). “As . . . enters the battlefield” and “as . . . is turned face up” abilities generate copiable effects if they set power and toughness, even if they also define other characteristics.

<b id='cr613-2b'>613.2b</b> 层1b：牌面朝下的咒语和永久物的特征根据规则[708.2](./7#cr708-2)的定义被改变。   
<b>613.2b</b> Layer 1b: Face-down spells and permanents have their characteristics modified as defined in rule 708.2.

<b id='cr613-2c'>613.2c</b> 在层1中的所有规则和效应生效后，该物件的特征成为其可复制特征值。（参见规则[707.2](./7#cr707-2)。）   
<b>613.2c</b> After all rules and effects in layer 1 have been applied, the object’s characteristics are its copiable values. (See rule 707.2.)

<b id='cr613-3'>613.3.</b> 在层2-6中，特征定义异能所产生的效应首先生效（参见规则[604.3](./6#cr604-3)），然后所有其他顺序按照时间印记顺序生效（参见规则[613.7](./6#cr613-7)）。注意，从属关系可能会改变同一层中效应生效的顺序。（参见规则[613.8](./6#cr613-8)。）   
<b>613.3.</b> Within layers 2–6, apply effects from characteristic-defining abilities first (see rule 604.3), then all other effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a layer. (See rule 613.8.)

<b id='cr613-4'>613.4.</b> 在层7中，效应以一系列副分层的形式按照以下顺序生效。在每个副分层中，效应按照时间印记顺序生效。（参见规则[613.7](./6#cr613-7)。）注意，从属关系可能会改变同一副分层中效应生效的顺序。（参见规则[613.8](./6#cr613-8)。）   
<b>613.4.</b> Within layer 7, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order. (See rule 613.7.) Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)

<b id='cr613-4a'>613.4a</b> 层7a：定义力量和/或防御力的特征定义异能所产生的效应生效。参见规则[604.3](./6#cr604-3)。   
<b>613.4a</b> Layer 7a: Effects from characteristic-defining abilities that define power and/or toughness are applied. See rule 604.3.

<b id='cr613-4b'>613.4b</b> 层7b：将力量和/或防御力设定为一个特定的数字或数值的效应生效。提及生物的基础力量和/或防御力的效应在此层生效。   
<b>613.4b</b> Layer 7b: Effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value are applied. Effects that refer to the base power and/or toughness of a creature apply in this layer.

<b id='cr613-4c'>613.4c</b> 层7c：影响力量和/或防御力（但不将力量和/或防御力设定为一个特定的数字或数值）的效应和指示物生效。   
<b>613.4c</b> Layer 7c: Effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness (but don’t set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value) are applied.

<b id='cr613-4d'>613.4d</b> 层7d：交换生物的力量和防御力的效应生效。此类效应将生物的力量给予其防御力，并将生物的防御力给予其力量。   
<b>613.4d</b> Layer 7d: Effects that switch a creature’s power and toughness are applied. Such effects take the value of power and apply it to the creature’s toughness, and take the value of toughness and apply it to the creature’s power.

例如：某效应给一个1/3生物+0/+1。然后另一个效应交换该生物的力量和防御力。其新的力量和防御力为4/1。一个新的效应令该生物+5/+0。它“未交换”的力量和防御力为6/4，所以其真正的力量和防御力为4/6。   
Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. A new effect gives the creature +5/+0. Its “unswitched” power and toughness would be 6/4, so its actual power and toughness is 4/6.

例如：某效应给一个1/3生物+0/+1。然后另一个效应交换该生物的力量和防御力。其新的力量和防御力为4/1。如果该+0/+1的效应在交换效应之前结束，该生物成为3/1。   
Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. If the +0/+1 effect ends before the switch effect ends, the creature becomes 3/1.

例如：某效应给一个1/3生物+0/+1。然后另一个效应交换该生物的力量和防御力。然后第三个效应再次交换该生物的力量和防御力。后两个效应互相抵消，该生物成为1/4。   
Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Then another effect switches its power and toughness again. The two switches essentially cancel each other, and the creature becomes 1/4.

<b id='cr613-5'>613.5.</b> 游戏持续并自动按照分层系统所决定的顺序令持续性效应生效。所有对物件的特征所作出的更改均在瞬间完成。   
<b>613.5.</b> The application of continuous effects as described by the layer system is continually and automatically performed by the game. All resulting changes to an object’s characteristics are instantaneous.

例如：纯净荣耀是一个具有“由你操控的白色生物得+1/+1”的结界。纯净荣耀和一个2/2黑色生物由你操控并在战场上。如果一个效应将令生物成为白色（层5），它因纯净荣耀得到+1/+1（层7c），成为3/3。如果该生物的颜色之后被改为红色（层5），纯净荣耀的效应将不再对其生效，它将回到2/2。   
Example: Honor of the Pure is an enchantment that reads “White creatures you control get +1/+1.” Honor of the Pure and a 2/2 black creature are on the battlefield under your control. If an effect then turns the creature white (layer 5), it gets +1/+1 from Honor of the Pure (layer 7c), becoming 3/3. If the creature’s color is later changed to red (layer 5), Honor of the Pure’s effect stops applying to it, and it will return to being 2/2.

例如：灰食人魔[Gray Ogre]为一个2/2生物，在战场上。一个效应在它上面放置了一个+1/+1指示物（层7c），令它成为3/3。一个以它为目标的咒语“目标生物得+4/+4直到回合结束”结算（层7c），令其成为7/7。一个具有“你所操控的生物得+0/+2”的结界进入战场（层7c），令其成为7/9。一个“目标生物成为0/1直到回合结束”的效应对其生效（层7b），令其成为5/8（0/1，加上结算的咒语+4/+4，加上结界+0/+2，加上指示物的+1/+1）。   
Example: Gray Ogre, a 2/2 creature, is on the battlefield. An effect puts a +1/+1 counter on it (layer 7c), making it 3/3. A spell targeting it that says “Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn” resolves (layer 7c), making it 7/7. An enchantment that says “Creatures you control get +0/+2” enters the battlefield (layer 7c), making it 7/9. An effect that says “Target creature becomes 0/1 until end of turn” is applied to it (layer 7b), making it 5/8 (0/1, with +4/+4 from the resolved spell, +0/+2 from the enchantment, and +1/+1 from the counter).

<b id='cr613-6'>613.6.</b> 如果一个效应将在多个层和/或副层中生效，效应的各个部分分别在它们对应的层中生效。如果一个效应开始在一个层和/或副层中生效，它将继续对同样的物件在其他适用的层和/或副层中生效，即使产生该效应的异能在此过程中被移除。   
<b>613.6.</b> If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers, the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate ones. If an effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer and/or sublayer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed during this process.

例如：“野杂种狗得+1/+1并成为你所选择的颜色直到回合结束”的效应同时是改变力量和防御力的效应和改变颜色的效应。“成为你所选择的颜色”部分在层5生效，然后“得+1/+1”部分在层7c生效。   
Example: An effect that reads “Wild Mongrel gets +1/+1 and becomes the color of your choice until end of turn” is both a power- and toughness-changing effect and a color-changing effect. The “becomes the color of your choice” part is applied in layer 5, and then the “gets +1/+1” part is applied in layer 7c.

例如：叛行具有效应“直到回合结束，获得目标生物的操控权。重置该生物。它获得敏捷异能直到回合结束。”这同时是改变操控权的效应和对物件添加异能的效应。“获得操控权”部分在层2生效，且然后“它获得敏捷异能”部分在层6生效。   
Example: Act of Treason has an effect that reads “Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.” This is both a control-changing effect and an effect that adds an ability to an object. The “gain control” part is applied in layer 2, and then the “it gains haste” part is applied in layer 6.

例如：“所有非生物神器成为2/2神器生物直到回合结束”同时是改变类别的效应和设定力量与防御力的效应。改变类别的效应在层4对所有非生物神器生效，而设定力量与防御力的效应对同样的永久物在层7b生效，即使这些永久物届时已经不再是非生物神器。   
Example: An effect that reads “All noncreature artifacts become 2/2 artifact creatures until end of turn” is both a type-changing effect and a power- and toughness-setting effect. The type-changing effect is applied to all noncreature artifacts in layer 4 and the power- and toughness-setting effect is applied to those same permanents in layer 7b, even though those permanents aren’t noncreature artifacts by then.

例如：不息之墓苏沃索在战场上。一个“直到回合结束，目标地成为3/3生物且依然是地”的效应对其生效（层4和7b）。一个“目标生物得+1/+1直到回合技术”的效应对其生效（层7c），令其成为4/4地生物。然后你在你的坟墓场中有十张生物牌的情况下起动苏沃索的异能：“直到回合结束，不息之墓苏沃索成为黑色和绿色的植物／灵俑生物并具有‘此生物的力量与防御力各等于你坟墓场中生物牌的数量。’它依然是地。”（层4、5、以及7b）。它将成为11/11地生物。如果一张生物牌进入或离开你的坟墓场，苏沃索的力量和防御力将随之改变。如果第一个效应再次对它生效，它将再次成为4/4地生物。   
Example: Svogthos, the Restless Tomb, is on the battlefield. An effect that says “Until end of turn, target land becomes a 3/3 creature that’s still a land” is applied to it (layers 4 and 7b). An effect that says “Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn” is applied to it (layer 7c), making it a 4/4 land creature. Then while you have ten creature cards in your graveyard, you activate Svogthos’s ability: “Until end of turn, Svogthos, the Restless Tomb becomes a black and green Plant Zombie creature with ‘This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.’ It’s still a land.” (layers 4, 5, and 7b). It becomes an 11/11 land creature. If a creature card enters or leaves your graveyard, Svogthos’s power and toughness will be modified accordingly. If the first effect is applied to it again, it will become a 4/4 land creature again.

<b id='cr613-7'>613.7.</b> 在同一层或副层中，一般情况下使用时间印记系统来决定效应生效的顺序。一个具有较早时间印记的效应在具有较晚时间印记的效应之前生效。   
<b>613.7.</b> Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is usually done using a timestamp system. An effect with an earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.

<b id='cr613-7a'>613.7a</b> 一个由静止式异能产生的持续性效应的时间印记为，该静止式异能所在的物件具有的时间印记，或创造该异能的效应具有的时间印记，两者中较晚的一个。如果创造该异能的效应具有较晚的时间印记，且该异能所处的物件获得新的时间印记，该物件的静止式异能所产生的每个持续性效应亦获得一个新的时间印记，但这些时间印记之间的相对顺序保持不变。   
<b>613.7a</b> A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same timestamp as the object the static ability is on, or the timestamp of the effect that created the ability, whichever is later. If the effect that created the ability has the later timestamp and the object the ability is on receives a new timestamp, each continuous effect generated by static abilities of that object receives a new timestamp as well, but the relative order of those timestamps remains the same.

例如：翔空符文是灵气，赋予所结附的武具“佩带此武具的生物具有飞行异能。”牌手将翔空符文贴附于巨锤上，一个具有“佩带此武具的生物得+10/+10且失去飞行异能。”的武具。由翔空符文赋予的异能与翔空符文具有相同的时间印记，因为其时间印记晚于巨锤的时间印记。如果巨锤此后贴附于一个生物，它的这两个异能均获得新的时间印记（参见规则[613.7e](./6#cr613-7e)），但这些时间印记的相对顺序保持不变。   
Example: Rune of Flight is an Aura that grants enchanted Equipment “Equipped creature has flying.” A player attaches Rune of Flight to Colossus Hammer, an Equipment with “Equipped creature gets +10/+10 and loses flying.” The ability granted by Rune of Flight shares Rune of Flight’s timestamp because it is later than Colossus Hammer’s timestamp. If Colossus Hammer becomes attached to a creature, both of its abilities receive new timestamps (see rule 613.7e), but the relative order of those timestamps remains the same.

<b id='cr613-7b'>613.7b</b> 一个由咒语或异能结算所产生的持续性效应在其被创造时得到时间印记。   
<b>613.7b</b> A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receives a timestamp at the time it’s created.

<b id='cr613-7c'>613.7c</b> 每个指示物会在其放置在一个物件或牌手上时得到时间印记。如果该物件或牌手上已经有同类指示物，每种该类指示物均会得到新的时间印记，且与新放置的指示物之时间印记相同。   
<b>613.7c</b> Each counter receives a timestamp as it’s put on an object or player. If that object or player already has a counter of that kind on it, each counter of that kind receives a new timestamp identical to that of the new counter.

<b id='cr613-7d'>613.7d</b> 一个物件会在进入一个区域时得到时间印记。   
<b>613.7d</b> An object receives a timestamp at the time it enters a zone.

<b id='cr613-7e'>613.7e</b> 每当一个灵气、武具、或工事贴附于一个物件或牌手上时，该灵气、武具、或工事得到新的时间印记。   
<b>613.7e</b> An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification receives a new timestamp each time it becomes attached to an object or player.

<b id='cr613-7f'>613.7f</b> 每当一个永久物翻回正面或翻为牌面朝下时，它得到新的时间印记。   
<b>613.7f</b> A permanent receives a new timestamp each time it turns face up or face down.

<b id='cr613-7g'>613.7g</b> 每当一个转化式双面永久物转化或转换时，它得到新的时间印记。   
<b>613.7g</b> A transforming double-faced permanent receives a new timestamp each time it transforms or converts.

<b id='cr613-7h'>613.7h</b> 牌面朝上的时空牌、异象牌或阴谋牌于其翻回正面时得到时间印记。   
<b>613.7h</b> A face-up plane card, phenomenon card, or scheme card receives a timestamp at the time it’s turned face up.

<b id='cr613-7i'>613.7i</b> 牌面朝上的先锋牌在游戏开始时得到时间印记。   
<b>613.7i</b> A face-up vanguard card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game.

<b id='cr613-7j'>613.7j</b> 诡局牌于游戏开始时得到时间印记。如果它是牌面朝下的，于其翻回正面时得到新的时间印记。   
<b>613.7j</b> A conspiracy card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game. If it’s face down, it receives a new timestamp at the time it turns face up.

<b id='cr613-7k'>613.7k</b> 贴纸于每次贴到物件上时得到新的时间印记。如果其上有贴纸的物件得到新的时间印记，该贴纸在这之后立即得到新的时间印记。如果其上有贴纸的物件成为战场上结聚永久物的一个组件，贴纸得到新的时间印记。如果其上有多张贴纸的物件进入一个区域或成为结聚永久物的一个组件，其上的贴纸的相对时间印记顺序不变。   
<b>613.7k</b> A sticker receives a new timestamp each time it’s put on an object. If the object a sticker is on receives a new timestamp, the sticker receives a new timestamp immediately after that one. If the object a sticker is on becomes part of a merged permanent on the battlefield, the sticker receives a new timestamp at that time. If an object has more than one sticker on it as it enters a zone or becomes part of a merged permanent, the relative timestamp order of those stickers remains unchanged.

<b id='cr613-7m'>613.7m</b> 如果两个或更多物件将同时得到时间印记，例如同时进入一个区域或同时成为被贴附，它们的时间印记先后顺序由“主动牌手先决定”顺序（参见规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)）决定。由主动牌手操控的物件（或对于没有操控者的物件，由该牌手拥有的）依该牌手选择的顺序具有较早的相对时间印记，然后依照回合顺序轮到每位其他牌手所操控（或拥有）的物件。   
<b>613.7m</b> If two or more objects would receive a timestamp simultaneously, such as by entering a zone simultaneously or becoming attached simultaneously, their relative timestamps are determined in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). Objects controlled by the active player (or owned by the active player, if they have no controller) have an earlier relative timestamp in the order of that player’s choice, followed by each other player in turn order.

<b id='cr613-8'>613.8.</b> 在一个层或副层中，有时使用从属系统来决定效应生效的顺序。如果存在从属关系，它将覆盖时间印记系统。   
<b>613.8.</b> Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.

<b id='cr613-8a'>613.8a</b> 如果一个效应（a）与另一个效应在同一层（或副层）中生效；（b）生效的顺序将改变第一个效应的叙述或存在、改变它将生效的对象、或改变它将生效的内容；以及（c）这两个效应都是或都不是特征定义异能，则第一个效应“从属于”第二个效应。否则，这两个效应不从属于彼此。   
<b>613.8a</b> An effect is said to “depend on” another if (a) it’s applied in the same layer (and, if applicable, sublayer) as the other effect; (b) applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from a characteristic-defining ability or both effects are from characteristic-defining abilities. Otherwise, the effect is considered to be independent of the other effect.

<b id='cr613-8b'>613.8b</b> 一个从属于一个或数个其他效应的效应等待直到这些效应均已生效。如果多个从属效应将同时生效，它们将按照相对的时间印记顺序生效。如果多个从属效应形成从属循环，则忽略此规则且这些在从属循环中的效应将按照时间印记顺序生效。   
<b>613.8b</b> An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects have been applied. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they’re applied in timestamp order relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.

<b id='cr613-8c'>613.8c</b> 在每个效应生效之后，将重新确定剩余效应生效的顺序，而且如果一个还没有生效的效应成为从属或不再从属于其他还没有生效的效应，顺序可能改变。   
<b>613.8c</b> After each effect is applied, the order of remaining effects is reevaluated and may change if an effect that has not yet been applied becomes dependent on or independent of one or more other effects that have not yet been applied.

<b id='cr613-9'>613.9.</b> 一个持续性效应可以覆盖另一个。有时一个效应的结果将决定另一个效应是否生效或该效应的内容。   
<b>613.9.</b> One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another effect does.

例如：两个结附于同一个生物上的灵气：其中一个为“所结附的生物具有飞行异能”而另一个为“所结附的生物失去飞行异能”。两者不从属于彼此，因为没有改变受它们影响的对象或它们影响的内容。令它们按照时间印记顺序生效表示最后产生的一个“获胜”。一个效应是否是暂时的（例如“目标生物失去飞行异能直到回合结束”）或广域的（例如“所有生物失去飞行异能”）并没有关系。   
Example: Two effects are affecting the same creature: one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature has flying” and one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature loses flying.” Neither of these depends on the other, since nothing changes what they affect or what they’re doing to it. Applying them in timestamp order means the one that was generated last “wins.” The same process would be followed, and the same result reached, if either of the effects had a duration (such as “Target creature loses flying until end of turn”) or came from a non-Aura source (such as “All creatures lose flying”).

例如：一个效应为“白色生物得+1/+1”，而另一个为“所结附的生物为白色”。则所结附的生物因第一个效应+1/+1，无论其之前的颜色。   
Example: One effect reads, “White creatures get +1/+1,” and another reads, “Enchanted creature is white.” The enchanted creature gets +1/+1 from the first effect, regardless of its previous color.

<b id='cr613-10'>613.10.</b> 一些持续性效应影响牌手而不是物件。例如，一个效应可能给予牌手反红保护。所有此类效应在决定物件的特征之后按照时间印记生效。参见时间印记和从属关系的规则（规则[613.7](./6#cr613-7)和[613.8](./6#cr613-8)）。   
<b>613.10.</b> Some continuous effects affect players rather than objects. For example, an effect might give a player protection from red. All such effects are applied in timestamp order after the determination of objects’ characteristics. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).

<b id='cr613-11'>613.11.</b> 一些持续性效应影响游戏规则而不是物件。例如，一个效应可能影响牌手的手牌上限，或令一个生物如能攻击则必须攻击。这些效应在所有其他持续性效应生效之后生效。影响咒语或异能费用的持续性效应按照规则[601.2f](./6#cr601-2f)中特定的顺序生效。所有其他效应按照时间印记顺序生效。参见时间印记和从属关系的规则（规则[613.7](./6#cr613-7)和[613.8](./6#cr613-8)）。   
<b>613.11.</b> Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects. For example, effects may modify a player’s maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able. These effects are applied after all other continuous effects have been applied. Continuous effects that affect the costs of spells or abilities are applied according to the order specified in rule 601.2f. All other such effects are applied in timestamp order. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).

## <span id='cr614'>614.</span> 替代性效应 Replacement Effects
<b id='cr614-1'>614.1.</b> 一些持续性效应为替代性效应。与防止性效应相同（参见规则[615](./6#cr615)），替代性效应于事件发生的过程中持续生效；它们不会事先锁定。此类效应注意将发生的某特殊事件并完全或部分的将该事件用另一个事件将其替代。它们如“护盾”一般对事件进行影响。   
<b>614.1.</b> Some continuous effects are replacement effects. Like prevention effects (see rule 615), replacement effects apply continuously as events happen—they aren’t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace that event with a different event. They act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.

<b id='cr614-1a'>614.1a</b> 使用“改为”一词的效应为替代性效应。大部分替代性效应使用“改为”一词来指出将被其他事件所替代的事件。   
<b>614.1a</b> Effects that use the word “instead” are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word “instead” to indicate what events will be replaced with other events.

<b id='cr614-1b'>614.1b</b> 使用“略过”一词的效应为替代性效应。这些效应使用“略过”一词来指出哪些事件、步骤、阶段、或回合将被没有任何事件发生所替代。   
<b>614.1b</b> Effects that use the word “skip” are replacement effects. These replacement effects use the word “skip” to indicate what events, steps, phases, or turns will be replaced with nothing.

<b id='cr614-1c'>614.1c</b> 格式为“[此永久物]进入战场带有……”、“于[此永久物]进入战场时……”、或“[此永久物]作为……进入战场”的效应为替代性效应。   
<b>614.1c</b> Effects that read “[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,” or “[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . “ are replacement effects.

<b id='cr614-1d'>614.1d</b> 格式为“[此永久物]……进入战场”或“[物件]……进入战场”的持续性效应为替代性效应。   
<b>614.1d</b> Continuous effects that read “[This permanent] enters the battlefield . . .” or “[Objects] enter the battlefield . . .” are replacement effects.

<b id='cr614-1e'>614.1e</b> 格式为“于[此永久物]翻回正面时……”的效应为替代性效应。   
<b>614.1e</b> Effects that read “As [this permanent] is turned face up . . . ,” are replacement effects.

<b id='cr614-2'>614.2.</b> 一些替代性效应从来源对伤害生效。参见规则[609.7](./6#cr609-7)。   
<b>614.2.</b> Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source. See rule 609.7.

<b id='cr614-3'>614.3.</b> 对施放咒语或起动异能所产生的替代性效应没有特殊的限制。这些效应直到它们被用掉或其有效期结束之前始终有效。   
<b>614.3.</b> There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a replacement effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired.

<b id='cr614-4'>614.4.</b> 替代性效应必须在对应的事件发生之前存在；它们不能“回溯”并改变已经发生的事情。产生这些效应的咒语或异能经常作为响应产生的事件来施放或起动，以导致将在事件发生之前结算。   
<b>614.4.</b> Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.

例如：某牌手可以响应将消灭一个生物的咒语起动一个将其重生的异能。但是一旦该咒语结算，再重生该生物便已经为时已晚。   
Example: A player can activate an ability to regenerate a creature in response to a spell that would destroy it. Once the spell resolves, though, it’s too late to regenerate the creature.

<b id='cr614-5'>614.5.</b> 一个替代性效应不会反复引发本身，且只有一次机会对一个事件或任何可能替代该事件的事件生效。   
<b>614.5.</b> A replacement effect doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly; it gets only one opportunity to affect an event or any modified events that may replace that event.

例如：某牌手操控两个永久物，各具有“如果一个你所操控的生物将对永久物或牌手造成伤害，改为对该永久物或牌手造成两倍的伤害”的异能。一般造成2点伤害的生物将造成8点伤害；不是4点，也不是无限点伤害。   
Example: A player controls two permanents, each with an ability that reads “If a creature you control would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead.” A creature that normally deals 2 damage will deal 8 damage—not just 4, and not an infinite amount.

<b id='cr614-6'>614.6.</b> 如果一个事件被替代，它从未发生过。改为发生被更改过的事件，且它可能会触发异能。注意，被更改过的事件可能包含无法作到的指示，在此情况下忽略该无法作到的指示。   
<b>614.6.</b> If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.

<b id='cr614-7'>614.7.</b> 如果一个替代性效应将替代一个事件，但该事件没有发生，则该替代性效应不会作任何事。   
<b>614.7.</b> If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect simply doesn’t do anything.

<b id='cr614-7a'>614.7a</b> 如果一个来源将造成0点伤害，它从未造成伤害。将增加该来源所造成伤害的替代性效应，或将令该来源对其他物件或牌手造成伤害，将没有任何事件来替代，所以它们将没有任何效应。   
<b>614.7a</b> If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. Replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.

<b id='cr614-8'>614.8.</b> 重生是一个替代消灭的效应。“改为”一词并没有出现在牌上，但隐含在重生的定义中。“重生[永久物]”表示“本回合中下一次[永久物]将被消灭时，改为移除它上面所有被标记的所有伤害，然后其操控者将它横置。如果它是一个攻击或阻挡中的生物，将其移出战斗。”因造成伤害而触发的异能即使该永久物重生也依然会触发。参见规则[701.15](./7#cr701-15)。   
<b>614.8.</b> Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word “instead” doesn’t appear on the card but is implicit in the definition of regeneration. “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and its controller taps it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.” Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates. See rule 701.15.

<b id='cr614-9'>614.9.</b> 一些效应将对一个战役、生物、鹏洛客、或牌手所造成的伤害替代为对另一个战役、生物、鹏洛客、或牌手造成伤害；此类效应被称为转移性效应。如果当伤害将被转移时其中一个永久物不再在战场上，或不再是战役、生物或鹏洛客，该效应将没有任何效果。如果伤害将转移到或从已经离开游戏的牌手上转移，该效应没有任何效果。   
<b>614.9.</b> Some effects replace damage dealt to one battle, creature, planeswalker, or player with the same damage dealt to another battle, creature, planeswalker, or player; such effects are called redirection effects. If one of those permanents is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be redirected, or is no longer a battle, creature, or planeswalker when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing. If damage would be redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does nothing.

<b id='cr614-10'>614.10.</b> 令牌手略过事件、步骤、或回合的效应为替代性效应。“略过[某事物]”与“作[某事物]改为不作任何事”意义相同。一旦一个步骤、阶段、或回合已经开始，它不再可以被略过；任何略过的效应将等到下一次该事物发生。   
<b>614.10.</b> An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. “Skip [something]” is the same as “Instead of doing [something], do nothing.” Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skipped—any skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.

<b id='cr614-10a'>614.10a</b> 任何对被略过的步骤、阶段、或回合作出的安排将不会发生。任何对“下一次”发生时机作出的安排将等到第一次发生且未被略过的时机。如果两个效应均将导致牌手略过其下一次发生时机，该牌手必须略过接下来的两次；略过一次发生时机将满足其中一个效应，而另一个效应将等到另一次发生时机被略过。   
<b>614.10a</b> Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won’t happen. Anything scheduled for the “next” occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn’t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip their next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.

<b id='cr614-10b'>614.10b</b> 一些效应令牌手略过步骤、阶段、或回合，然后作另一个动作。该动作将被视为之后真正发生的步骤、阶段、或回合中最先发生的事。   
<b>614.10b</b> Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then take another action. That action is considered to be the first thing that happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actually occur.

<b id='cr614-11'>614.11.</b> 一些效应替代抓牌。这些效应即使在受影响牌手的牌库中无牌可抓时也同样生效。   
<b>614.11.</b> Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player’s library.

<b id='cr614-11a'>614.11a</b> 如果一个效应替代一系列抓牌其中的一次抓牌，则所有进行替代的动作完成之后才可以继续此系列抓牌。   
<b>614.11a</b> If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, all actions required by the replacement are completed, if possible, before resuming the sequence.

<b id='cr614-11b'>614.11b</b> 如果一个效应令牌手抓牌并且对该牌作额外的动作，且该抓牌被替代，则不会对该替代性效应所导致的任何抓牌进行这些额外的动作。   
<b>614.11b</b> If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an additional action on that card, and the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect.

<b id='cr614-12'>614.12.</b> 一些替代性效应影响一个永久物如何进入战场。（参见规则[614.1c-d](./6#cr614-1c)。）这些效应如果只影响该永久物则可能来自该永久物本身（而不是影响包含该永久物在内的某一组永久物）。它们也可能来自其他来源。要决定这些替代性效应如何及是否生效，检查该永久物将存在于战场上的特征，并将已经影响其如何进入战场的替代性效应（参见规则[616.1](./6#cr616-1)）、该永久物在战场上之后将对其生效的其本身的静止式异能所产生的持续性效应、以及已经存在的并将影响该永久物的持续性效应计算在内。   
<b>614.12.</b> Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules 614.1c–d.) Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.

例如：万物使者具有“于万物使者进入战场时，选择一个颜色”以及“万物使者具有所选择颜色的反色保护”。某效应派出了一个复制万物使者的衍生物。于该衍生物被派出时，该衍生物的操控者为其选择一个颜色。   
Example: Voice of All says “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color” and “Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.” An effect creates a token that’s a copy of Voice of All. As that token is created, the token’s controller chooses a color for it.

例如：异西里狱卒具有“坟墓场中的牌失去所有异能”。伤痕林树妖具有“伤痕林树妖横置进入战场”。从坟墓场中进入战场的伤痕林树妖横置进入战场。   
Example: Yixlid Jailer says “Cards in graveyards lose all abilities.” Scarwood Treefolk says “Scarwood Treefolk enters the battlefield tapped.” A Scarwood Treefolk that’s put onto the battlefield from a graveyard enters the battlefield tapped.

例如：眠梦法球是具有“永久物横置进入战场”的神器。它将不会影响其本身，所以眠梦法球以未横置进入战场。   
Example: Orb of Dreams is an artifact that says “Permanents enter the battlefield tapped.” It won’t affect itself, so Orb of Dreams enters the battlefield untapped.

<b id='cr614-12a'>614.12a</b> 如果一个替代性效应影响一个永久物如何进入战场，但需要作出选择，该选择在永久物进入战场之前作出。   
<b>614.12a</b> If a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield.

<b id='cr614-12b'>614.12b</b> 一些替代性效应使得永久物进战场时由其操控者选择两种异能之一，且这两种异能均以锚定词开头，以项目列表的格式列出。“[锚定词]～[异能]”意指“只要此永久物进战场时选择了[锚定词]，此永久物便具有[异能]。”以锚定词开头的异能与允许牌手选择锚定词的异能相互关联。参见规则[607](./6#cr607)，“关联异能”。   
<b>614.12b</b> Some replacement effects cause a permanent to enter the battlefield with its controller’s choice of one of two abilities, each marked with an anchor word and preceded by a bullet point. “[Anchor word] — [ability]” means “As long as [anchor word] was chosen as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability].” The abilities preceded by anchor words are each linked to the ability that causes a player to choose between them. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”

<b id='cr614-13'>614.13.</b> 影响一个永久物如何进入战场的效应可能会令其他物件改变区域。   
<b>614.13.</b> An effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield may cause other objects to change zones.

<b id='cr614-13a'>614.13a</b> 当一个影响永久物如何进入战场的效应生效时，你可能需要选择数个亦要改变区域的物件。你不能选择将成为该永久物的物件、或任何与该物件同时进入战场的其他物件。   
<b>614.13a</b> While applying an effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield, you may have to choose a number of objects that will also change zones. You can’t choose the object that will become that permanent or any other object entering the battlefield at the same time as that object.

例如：缝组食尸鬼的一部分异能为：“于缝组食尸鬼进战场时，从你的坟墓场放逐任意数量的生物牌。”如果缝组食尸鬼和符爪熊从你的坟墓场同时进入战场，在缝组食尸鬼的替代性效应生效时，你既不能选择放逐缝组食尸鬼，也不能选择放逐符爪熊。   
Example: Sutured Ghoul says, in part, “As Sutured Ghoul enters the battlefield, exile any number of creature cards from your graveyard.” If Sutured Ghoul and Runeclaw Bear enter the battlefield from your graveyard at the same time, you can’t choose to exile either of them when applying Sutured Ghoul’s replacement effect.

<b id='cr614-13b'>614.13b</b> 在影响一个永久物如何进入战场的效应生效时，不能选择令同一个物件改变区域多于一次。   
<b>614.13b</b> The same object can’t be chosen to change zones more than once when applying replacement effects that modify how a single permanent enters the battlefield.

例如：勇得（时空牌）具有异能“每当一位牌手施放一个黑色，红色或绿色生物咒语时，该咒语获得吞噬5。”一位牌手操控符爪熊，然后施放雷击族长老，它是一个具有吞噬3的红色生物咒语。于雷击族长老进入战场时，其操控者可以选择牺牲符爪熊使吞噬3的效应生效，也可以选择牺牲符爪熊使吞噬5的效应生效，但不能牺牲同一个符爪熊使两个效应都生效。该牌手可以选择使雷击族长老带有零个、三个或者五个+1/+1指示物进入战场。   
Example: Jund (a plane card) says, “Whenever a player casts a black, red, or green creature spell, it gains devour 5.” A player controls Runeclaw Bear and casts Thunder-Thrash Elder, a red creature spell with devour 3. As Thunder-Thrash Elder enters the battlefield, its controller can choose to sacrifice Runeclaw Bear when applying the devour 3 effect or when applying the devour 5 effect, but not both. Thunder-Thrash Elder will enter the battlefield with zero, three, or five +1/+1 counters, depending on this choice.

<b id='cr614-13c'>614.13c</b> 在一个影响永久物如何进入战场的替代性效应生效时，另一个替代性效应可能使得牌手磨牌或是从牌库顶放逐牌。这种情况下，任何从牌库进战场的牌不会被该效应包括在内，即使这些牌在该效应生效时仍在牌库中。   
<b>614.13c</b> While applying a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield, another replacement effect may cause a player to mill cards or exile cards from the top of a library. In that case, any card that is entering the battlefield from that library won’t be included in that effect, even though those cards are in the library as the effect is applied.

例如：弄恶安梭苛具有异能“如果你将支付生命时你牌库中有至少相同数量的牌，则改为从你牌库顶放逐等量的牌。”滋生之池是具有异能“于滋生之池进战场时，你可以支付2点生命。”的地。如果牌手操控弄恶安梭苛，某效应允许该牌手从牌库顶使用滋生之池，而其选择于滋生之池进战场时支付生命，则安梭苛的替代性效应将忽略滋生之池，因为它正进战场。牌库顶接下来的两张牌将被放逐。   
Example: Ashiok, Wicked Manipulator has an ability that reads “If you would pay life while your library has at least that many cards in it, exile that many cards from the top of your library instead.” Breeding Pool is a land that reads, in part, “As Breeding Pool enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life.” If an effect allows a player to play Breeding Pool from the top of their library while they control Ashiok, and they choose to pay life as Breeding Pool enters, Ashiok’s replacement effect will ignore Breeding Pool, because it is entering the battlefield, and the next two cards will be exiled.

<b id='cr614-14'>614.14.</b> 一个物件可能印有一个产生替代性效应的异能，该异能将导致一张或数张牌被放逐，以及另一个异能提及“被放逐的牌”或“被[此物件]放逐”的牌。这些异能互相关联：第二个异能提及的牌只包括放逐区中被第一个异能所产生的替代事件直接放逐的牌。如果另一个物件得到一对关联异能，这些异能在该物件上会以类似的形式互相关联。他们不能与任何其他异能有所关联，无论该物件当前或之前可能具有的其他异能。参见规则[607](./6#cr607)，“关联异能”。   
<b>614.14.</b> An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of the replacement event caused by the first. If another object gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”

<b id='cr614-15'>614.15.</b> 一些替代性效应不是持续性效应。它们由结算中的咒语或异能具有，替代该咒语或异能本身的一部分或全部效应。此类效应被称为自我替代性效应。创造自我替代性效应的叙述一般是效应即将被替代的异能的一部分，但是叙述也可以是另外一个单独的异能，尤其是以一个异能提示开头的时候。当替代性效应对一个事件生效时，自我替代性效应在其他替代性效应之前生效。   
<b>614.15.</b> Some replacement effects are not continuous effects. Rather, they are an effect of a resolving spell or ability that replace part or all of that spell or ability’s own effect(s). Such effects are called self-replacement effects. The text creating a self-replacement effect is usually part of the ability whose effect is being replaced, but the text can be a separate ability, particularly when preceded by an ability word. When applying replacement effects to an event, self-replacement effects are applied before other replacement effects.

<b id='cr614-16'>614.16.</b> 一些替代性效应对“如果某效应将派出一个或数个衍生物”或“如果某效应将在永久物上放置一个或数个指示物”生效。这些替代性效应当一个结算中的咒语或异能派出衍生物或在永久物上放置指示物时生效，也会当另一个替代性效应或防止性效应如此作时生效，即使被更改的原事件本身并不是效应。   
<b>614.16.</b> Some replacement effects apply “if an effect would create one or more tokens” or “if an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent.” These replacement effects apply if the effect of a resolving spell or ability creates a token or puts a counter on a permanent, and they also apply if another replacement or prevention effect does so, even if the original event being modified wasn’t itself an effect.

<b id='cr614-17'>614.17.</b> 一些效应叙述某事不能发生。这些效应不是替代性效应，但遵循类似的规则。   
<b>614.17.</b> Some effects state that something can’t happen. These effects aren’t replacement effects, but follow similar rules.

<b id='cr614-17a'>614.17a</b> “不能”类效应必须在对应的事件发生之前存在；它们不能“回溯”并改变已经发生的事情。   
<b>614.17a</b> “Can’t” effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened.

<b id='cr614-17b'>614.17b</b> 如果一个事件不能发生，牌手不能选择支付包含该事件的费用。   
<b>614.17b</b> If an event can’t happen, a player can’t choose to pay a cost that includes that event.

<b id='cr614-17c'>614.17c</b> 如果一个事件不能发生，它只能被自我替代性效应（参见规则[614.15](./6#cr614-15)）替代。其他替代性效应和/或防止性效应不能影响或替代之。   
<b>614.17c</b> If an event can’t happen, it can only be replaced by a self-replacement effect (see rule 614.15). Other replacement and/or prevention effects can’t modify or replace it.

<b id='cr614-17d'>614.17d</b> 一些“不能”类效应影响一个永久物如何进入战场、或其是否能进入战场。这些效应如果只影响该永久物则可能来自该永久物本身（而不是影响包含该永久物在内的某一组永久物）。它们也可能来自其他来源。要决定哪些“不能”类效应生效，检查该永久物将存在于战场上的特征，并将已经影响其如何进入战场的替代性效应（参见规则[616.1](./6#cr616-1)）、该永久物在战场上之后将对其生效的其本身的静止式异能所产生的持续性效应、以及已经存在的并将影响该永久物的持续性效应计算在内。   
<b>614.17d</b> Some “can’t” effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield or whether it can enter the battlefield. Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which “can’t” effects apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.

## <span id='cr615'>615.</span> 防止性效应 Prevention Effects
<b id='cr615-1'>615.1.</b> 一些持续性效应为防止性效应。与替代性效应相同（参见规则[614](./6#cr614)），防止性效应于事件发生的过程中持续生效；它们不会事先锁定。此类效应注意将发生的伤害事件并完全或部分防止将造成的伤害。它们如“护盾”一般对事件进行影响。   
<b>615.1.</b> Some continuous effects are prevention effects. Like replacement effects (see rule 614), prevention effects apply continuously as events happen—they aren’t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a damage event that would happen and completely or partially prevent the damage that would be dealt. They act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.

<b id='cr615-1a'>615.1a</b> 使用“防止”一词的效应为防止性效应。防止性效应使用“防止”一词来指定将不会造成哪些伤害。   
<b>615.1a</b> Effects that use the word “prevent” are prevention effects. Prevention effects use “prevent” to indicate what damage will not be dealt.

<b id='cr615-2'>615.2.</b> 很多防止性效应从来源对伤害生效。参见规则[609.7](./6#cr609-7)。   
<b>615.2.</b> Many prevention effects apply to damage from a source. See rule 609.7.

<b id='cr615-3'>615.3.</b> 对施放咒语或起动异能所产生的防止性效应没有特殊的限制。这些效应直到它们被用掉或其有效期结束之前始终有效。   
<b>615.3.</b> There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a prevention effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired.

<b id='cr615-4'>615.4.</b> 防止性效应必须在对应的事件发生之前存在；它们不能“回溯”并改变已经发生的事情。产生这些效应的咒语或异能经常作为响应产生的事件来施放或起动，以导致将在事件发生之前结算。   
<b>615.4.</b> Prevention effects must exist before the appropriate damage event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.

例如：牌手可以响应将造成伤害的咒语起动一个防止伤害的异能。但是一旦该咒语结算，再防止伤害便已经为时已晚。   
Example: A player can activate an ability that prevents damage in response to a spell that would deal damage. Once the spell resolves, though, it’s too late to prevent the damage.

<b id='cr615-5'>615.5.</b> 一些防止性效应包括额外效应，它可能会提及被防止的伤害数量。防止本身将在原事件发生的时刻；效应其余的部分在此之后马上进行。   
<b>615.5.</b> Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which may refer to the amount of damage that was prevented. The prevention takes place at the time the original event would have happened; the rest of the effect takes place immediately afterward.

<b id='cr615-6'>615.6.</b> 如果将造成的伤害被防止，则它从未造成。改为发生被更改过的事件，且它可能会触发异能。注意，被更改过的事件可能包含无法作到的指示，在此情况下忽略该无法作到的指示。   
<b>615.6.</b> If damage that would be dealt is prevented, it never happens. A modified event may occur instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.

<b id='cr615-7'>615.7.</b> 一些由咒语或异能的结算而产生的防止性效应提及特定数量的伤害；例如，“防止本回合中接下来将对任意一个目标造成的3点伤害。”它们如护盾一般。将对该具有“护盾”的永久物或牌手造成的每1点伤害均将被防止。每防止1点伤害则剩余的护盾减少1。如果有两个或以上适用的来源将对具有护盾的永久物或牌手同时造成伤害，该牌手或该永久物的操控者选择该护盾将防止哪些伤害。此类效应只计算伤害的数量；造成伤害的事件或来源数量无关紧要。   
<b>615.7.</b> Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.” These work like shields. Each 1 damage that would be dealt to the “shielded” permanent or player is prevented. Preventing 1 damage reduces the remaining shield by 1. If damage would be dealt to the shielded permanent or player by two or more applicable sources at the same time, the player or the controller of the permanent chooses which damage the shield prevents. Once the shield has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt normally. Such effects count only the amount of damage; the number of events or sources dealing it doesn’t matter.

<b id='cr615-8'>615.8.</b> 一些由咒语或异能的结算而产生的防止性效应提及某特定来源下一次将造成的伤害。这些效应防止来自该来源下一次的伤害，无论该伤害的数量。一旦该来源的伤害被防止过一次，任何该来源将造成的伤害将正常进行。   
<b>615.8.</b> Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to the next time a specific source would deal damage. These effects prevent the next instance of damage from that source, regardless of how much damage that is. Once an instance of damage from that source has been prevented, any subsequent instances of damage that would be dealt by that source are dealt normally.

<b id='cr615-9'>615.9.</b> 一些由咒语或异能的结算而产生的效应防止由牌手选择的、且具有特定属性的来源造成之伤害。当该来源将造成伤害时，护盾将重新检查来源的属性。如果属性不再符合，则该伤害不会被防止或替代，且该护盾不会用掉。参见规则[609.7b](./6#cr609-7b)。   
<b>615.9.</b> Some effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability prevent damage from a source of a player’s choice with certain properties. When the source would deal damage, the shield rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced and the shield isn’t used up. See rule 609.7b.

<b id='cr615-10'>615.10.</b> 一些由静止式异能所产生的防止性效应提及某特定数量的伤害；例如，“如果一个来源将对你造成伤害，防止其中1点伤害。”此类效应在任何时间的任何伤害事件中只防止指定数量的伤害。它将对同一时刻或其他时刻来自其他适用来源的伤害分别生效。   
<b>615.10.</b> Some prevention effects generated by static abilities refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “If a source would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage.” Such an effect prevents only the indicated amount of damage in any applicable damage event at any given time. It will apply separately to damage from other applicable events that would happen at the same time, or at a different time.

例如：威吓捍卫者具有“如果一个来源将对你所操控的僧侣生物造成伤害，防止其中1点伤害。”烈火断层为“烈火断层对每个生物造成2点伤害。”烈火断层将对威吓捍卫者的操控者所操控的每个僧侣生物各造成1点伤害。它将对每个其他生物各造成2点伤害。   
Example: Daunting Defender says “If a source would deal damage to a Cleric creature you control, prevent 1 of that damage.” Pyroclasm says “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm will deal 1 damage to each Cleric creature controlled by Daunting Defender’s controller. It will deal 2 damage to each other creature.

<b id='cr615-11'>615.11.</b> 一些防止性效应将对一定数量且未指定目标的生物各防止接下来的N点伤害。此类效应在产生该效应的咒语或异能结算时，为每个适用的生物各创造了一个防止护盾。   
<b>615.11.</b> Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to each of a number of untargeted creatures. Such an effect creates a prevention shield for each applicable creature when the spell or ability that generates that effect resolves.

例如：沃耶克药剂师具有异能“{T}：防止本回合中接下来将对目标生物以及其他每个与该生物共有颜色的生物所造成的1点伤害。”当该异能结算时，它给予目标生物，以及此时战场上与它共有颜色的每个其他生物，各一个防止接下来将对其造成的1点伤害的护盾。在该异能结算之后改变生物的颜色不会添加或移除护盾，且本回合之后进入战场的生物不会得到护盾。   
Example: Wojek Apothecary has an ability that says “{T}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature and each other creature that shares a color with it this turn.” When the ability resolves, it gives the target creature and each other creature on the battlefield that shares a color with it at that time a shield preventing the next 1 damage that would be dealt to it. Changing creatures’ colors after the ability resolves doesn’t add or remove shields, and creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn don’t get the shield.

<b id='cr615-12'>615.12.</b> 一些效应指明该伤害“不能被防止”。如果将造成不能被防止的伤害，任何适用的防止性效应依然对其生效。这些效应将不会防止任何伤害，但它们具有的任何额外效应依然进行。已经存在的伤害防止护盾不会因为不能被防止的伤害而减少。   
<b>615.12.</b> Some effects state that damage “can’t be prevented.” If unpreventable damage would be dealt, any applicable prevention effects are still applied to it. Those effects won’t prevent any damage, but any additional effects they have will take place. Existing damage prevention shields won’t be reduced by damage that can’t be prevented.

<b id='cr615-12a'>615.12a</b> 防止性效应对任何一个不能被防止的伤害事件只生效一次。它不会反复引发本身来尝试防止该伤害。   
<b>615.12a</b> A prevention effect is applied to any particular unpreventable damage event just once. It won’t invoke itself repeatedly trying to prevent that damage.

<b id='cr615-13'>615.13.</b> 一些触发式异能在将要造成的伤害被防止时触发。此类异能在每当有一个防止性效应对一个或数个同时发生的伤害事件生效、且防止部分或全部该伤害时，就会触发一次。   
<b>615.13.</b> Some triggered abilities trigger when damage that would be dealt is prevented. Such an ability triggers each time a prevention effect is applied to one or more simultaneous damage events and prevents some or all of that damage.

<b id='cr616-1'>616.1.</b> 如果两个或更多替代性和/或防止性效应尝试改变一个事件如何影响一个物件或牌手，受影响物件的操控者（或如果没有操控者则其拥有者）或受影响的牌手按照以下列出的顺序，选择其中一个生效。如果两个或更多牌手需要同时作出选择，则按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序作出选择（参见规则[101.4](./1#cr101-4)）。   
<b>616.1.</b> If two or more replacement and/or prevention effects are attempting to modify the way an event affects an object or player, the affected object’s controller (or its owner if it has no controller) or the affected player chooses one to apply, following the steps listed below.

<b id='cr616-1a'>616.1a</b> 如果任何替代性和/或防止性效应为自我替代性效应（参见规则[614.15](./6#cr614-15)），则必须选择它们其中之一。如果没有，则继续至规则[616.1b](./6#cr616-1b)。   
<b>616.1a</b> If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects are self-replacement effects (see rule 614.15), one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule 616.1b.

<b>616.1c</b> If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would cause an object to become a copy of another object as it enters the battlefield, one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule 616.1d.

<b id='cr616-1d'>616.1d</b> 如果任何替代性和/或防止性效应将使一张牌以背面朝上的方式进入战场，则必须选择它们其中之一（参见规则[701.28](./7#cr701-28)，“转化”，及规则[701.50](./7#cr701-50)，“转换”）。如果没有，则继续至规则[616.1e](./6#cr616-1e)。   
<b>616.1d</b> If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would cause a card to enter the battlefield with its back face up, one of them must be chosen (See rule 701.28, “Transform,” and rule 701.50, “Convert.”). If not, proceed to 616.1e.

<b id='cr616-1e'>616.1e</b> 任何适用的替代性效应和/或防止性效应均可以被选择。   
<b>616.1e</b> Any of the applicable replacement and/or prevention effects may be chosen.

<b>616.1f</b> Once the chosen effect has been applied, this process is repeated (taking into account only replacement or prevention effects that would now be applicable) until there are no more left to apply.

例如：战场上有两个永久物。其中一个是具有“如果一张牌将从任何地方进入坟墓场，改为将其放逐”的结界，而另一个是具有“如果[此生物]将死去，改为将其洗回其拥有者的牌库”的生物。该生物的操控者决定该生物将被消灭时哪个替代性效应首先生效；另一个将没有效果。   
Example: Two permanents are on the battlefield. One is an enchantment that reads “If a card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, instead exile it,” and the other is a creature that reads “If [this creature] would die, instead shuffle it into its owner’s library.” If the creature is destroyed, its controller decides which replacement to apply first; the other does nothing.

例如：蛮荒精魂具有“由你操控的生物进战场时是蛮荒精魂的复制品。”一位牌手操控蛮荒精魂时施放生锈哨兵，该生物通常横置进战场。当其进战场时，蛮荒精魂的复制效应先生效。作为其结果，它不再具有令其横置进战场的异能。生锈哨兵进战场时将是未横置的蛮荒精魂之复制。   
Example: Essence of the Wild reads “Creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of Essence of the Wild.” A player who controls Essence of the Wild casts Rusted Sentinel, which normally enters the battlefield tapped. As it enters the battlefield, the copy effect from Essence of the Wild is applied first. As a result, it no longer has the ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped. Rusted Sentinel will enter the battlefield as an untapped copy of Essence of the Wild.

<b id='cr616-1g'>616.1g</b> 于遵循616.1a-f叙述之步骤时，一个替代性或防止性效应可能对某事件生效，而另一个替代性或防止性效应可能对一个包含在前者事件中的事件生效。在此情形下，后者效应不能被选择，直到前者效应被选择为止。   
<b>616.1g</b> While following the steps in 616.1a–f, one replacement or prevention effect may apply to an event, and another may apply to an event contained within the first event. In this case, the second effect can’t be chosen until after the first effect has been chosen.

例如：牌手被指示派出一个衍生物，且为万物使者的复制，其具有异能“于万物使者进战场时，选择一种颜色。”倍产旺季具有异能叙述为“若任一效应将派出一个或数个衍生物并由你操控，则改为派出两倍数量的衍生物。”由于进入战场此事件包含在派出衍生物中，倍产旺季的效应必须首先生效，然后两个万物使者衍生物的效应以任意顺序生效。   
Example: A player is instructed to create a token that’s a copy of Voice of All, which has the ability “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.” Doubling Season has an ability that reads “If an effect would create one or more tokens under your control, it creates twice that many of those tokens instead.” Because entering the battlefield is an event contained within the event of creating a token, the effect of Doubling Season must be applied first, and then the effects of the two Voice of All tokens may be applied in either order.

<b id='cr616-2'>616.2.</b> 一个替代性或防止性效应可能将由于另一个影响某事件的替代性或防止性效应成为对该事件适用。   
<b>616.2.</b> A replacement or prevention effect can become applicable to an event as the result of another replacement or prevention effect that modifies the event.

例如：一个效应为“如果你将获得生命，改为抓等量的牌”，而另一个效应为“如果你将抓一张牌，改为将一张牌从你的坟墓场移回你的手上”。这两个效应结合（无论它们存在的顺序）：得到1点生命改为该牌手从他的坟墓场将一张牌移回他的手上。   
Example: One effect reads “If you would gain life, draw that many cards instead,” and another reads “If you would draw a card, return a card from your graveyard to your hand instead.” Both effects combine (regardless of the order they came into existence): Instead of gaining 1 life, the player puts a card from their graveyard into their hand.
